LATIN NAME(S)  Crucibulum crucibuliforme  (Scop.) V.S. White^  Bull. Torrey bot. Club 29: 269. 1902;  Crucibulum laeve  (Huds.) Kambly, Kambly, and Lee  Univ. of Iowa Stud. Nat. Hist. 17(4): 167. 1936;  Cyathus laevis  DC;  Crucibulum vulgare  Tul.
ENGLISH NAME(S)  white-egg bird's nest, common birds' nest, yellow bird's nest fungus, common bird's nest fungus
NOTES  {See also Common Bird's Nests Table.} Features include nearly spherical to short-cylindric thick-walled nest with a coarsely tomentose lid; exterior that is yellowish to tawny or cinnamon brown becoming whiter or darker, and velvety becoming smooth; interior that is whitish to grayish or pale brown and shiny smooth; eggs that are whitish to light brownish, attached by a papilla to a cord that is joined to the inside of the cup; and growth on sticks, plant debris or sometimes dung.^  MycoBank, accessed on February 6, 2018, gave the name Crucibulum laeve (Huds.) Kambly as illegitimate and gives the current name as  Crucibulum crucibuliforme (Scop.) V.S. White. MycoBank says that the name is a nomen superfluum - as 'levis'; it should have been based on Peziza crucibuliformis Scopoli. RANGE Crucibulum laeve has been found in WA, OR, MT, and also AL, CT, IN, KS, KY, MA, ME, NJ, NY, PA, and VA, (White), CA (Arora), AK to Mexico, BC, AB, Chile, almost every country of Europe, Canary Islands, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, (Brodie(1)). It is common in BC (Oluna Ceska pers. comm.), WA and OR (Lorelei Norvell, pers. comm.). It was photographed in ID by Kit Scates-Barnhart.
NEST  0.5-1.2cm broad at top, 0.5-1.2cm high, at first nearly round, becoming cylindric "then deeply cup-shaped (i.e. with a wide flaring mouth)", "the rim more or less circular and covered at first by a hairy lid", wall tough, persistent^, (Arora), 0.5-0.8cm high, almost as wide at mouth, nearly spherical to short-cylindric, thick-walled, mouth entirely smooth; lid coarsely tomentose, (Brodie(1)), 1cm across, 0.5-1cm high, narrowing downward; mouth at first covered by densely hairy lid, (Phillips), lid orange-yellow then white, (Courtecuisse)
OUTER SURFACE  yellowish or tawny to cinnamon brown, often darker or whiter when old; velvety or shaggy, becoming nearly smooth when old^, (Arora), alutaceous-yellow, tawny-yellow, becoming white when old; velvety, becoming smooth when old, (Brodie(1)), yellow ocher to tawny brown; velvety, (Phillips), yellowish gray-brown; +/- fibrillose, (Courtecuisse)
INNER SURFACE  white to silvery, gray, or pale cinnamon; smooth, somewhat shiny^, (Arora), very smooth, shiny, (Brodie(1)), pallid; smooth, shiny, (Phillips)
EGGS  0.1-0.2cm across, several, circular but flattened (lens-like or disc-like), "usually attached to nest by long thin cords"; "whitish to buff or with a very slight brownish tinge"^, (Arora), 0.04cm thick, frequently 0.14cm across, occasionally 0.16-0.2cm across, variable in size, even in the same cup, attached to cup by cord that attaches to a nipple-like protuberance on egg; pale ochraceous, later becoming white, (Brodie(1)), 0.15cm across, white, attached to cup by long thin cord, (Phillips), 5-12 per cup, lens-shaped, attached by short thread; ocher, (Courtecuisse), attached by coiled cords, (Lincoff(2)), eggs develop and stay for some time in a gelatinous liquid, (Lincoff(1))
EDIBILITY  no (Phillips)
HABITAT  scattered to densely gregarious "on sticks, wood chips, nut shells, vegetable debris, humus, and manure"^, (Arora), "on stems, twigs, old nut shells, chips, old matting, and on manure", but not on soil or large logs, (Brodie(1)), on decaying logs and twigs, July to October, (Phillips), spring to late fall (Lincoff(1))
MICROSCOPIC  spores (4)7-10 x 3-6 microns, elliptic, smooth, colorless, thin-walled^, (Arora), spores 8.8 x 4.4 microns, elliptic, (Brodie(1)), spores 4-10 x 4-6 microns, elliptic, smooth, (Phillips)
NAME ORIGIN  from Latin meaning "smooth"^, (Brodie(1))
SIMILAR  Crucibulum parvulum differs in having 1) nest size smaller (mostly 0.2-0.4cm high instead of usually about 0.8cm high), 2) nest shape that is strongly obconic nest whereas the nest of C. laeve is mug-shaped, 3) nest wall that is brittle and thin, 0.02cm, instead of massive and thick, 0.025-0.05cm or more, 4) external color when young that is white, gray or pale buff, never yellow, whereas C. laeve when young is some shade of yellow or brown, 5) external tomentum that is very delicate and inconspicuous instead of velvety and conspicuous when young, 6) eggs that are smaller, 0.05-0.125cm across instead of 0.125-0.225cm across, with a thin instead of moderately thick tunica, 7) epiphragm [lid of nest] that is fragile with little tomentum, instead of being tough and covered with yellowish tomentum, and 8) spore size that is 7-8 x 4-5cm instead of 8-10 x 4-6 microns, (Brodie(5)). Nidula species do not have a cord attaching the eggs to the nest, and eggs are darker, (Brodie(1)). Cyathus species have a cord attaching the eggs to the nest but it is not attached to a little nipple-like protuberance on the egg, and the eggs are darker, (Brodie(1)).

LATIN NAME(S)  Cyathus helenae  H.J. Brodie^  Can. J. Bot. 44: 1235. 1966
ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Cyathus helenae is a small inverted cone-shaped cup that flares out sharply in upper third. The outer surface is pale brown to gray, covered with down-pointing hairs aggregated into coarse regular nodules. The lip of the cup is minutely fringed but not with setae. the inner surface faintly pleated, gray, and shiny. The angular eggs have a silvery tunica.^ RANGE It is found at least in AB and ID, (Brodie(1)), and MB (Olchowecki).
NEST  0.5-0.6cm wide at the mouth, 0.7cm high; peridium obconic, thick, flaring outward sharply in the upper third, but base massive, wider than cup, lip minutely fimbriate [fringed]^ but not setose, (Brodie(1)); lip may be minutely fimbriate, lid thin, fleeting, white; emplacement has sand as well as organic debris incorporated, gray mycelial cords or rhizomorphs extend outward over ground from bases of some fruitbodies, (Brodie(2))
OUTER SURFACE  outer surface pale brown to gray, covered with down-pointing hairs aggregated into nodules^, (Brodie(1)), peculiar tufted tomentum (Olchowecki), pale brown to gray, fresh specimens close to Ridgway's "sayal brown", (Brodie(2))
INNER SURFACE  gray, silvery; shiny, faintly but distinctly pleated, lip dark brown toward the inside^, (Brodie(1)), "gray or silvery, but the lip is distinctly brown toward the inside", (Brodie(2))

ENGLISH NAME(S)  ribbed splashcup, splash cups, streaked bird's-nest, fluted bird's-nest
NOTES  {See also Common Bird's Nests Table.} Features include 1) an inverted cone-shaped, shaggy brown cup with setae on the edge, 2) strongly radially striate, brownish gray interior covered at first by a whitish membrane, and 3) slightly triangular dark eggs attached by a cord.^ The sides of the cup are angled so that raindrops falling into the mushrooms dislodge the spore sacs (eggs), (Lincoff(2)). In the air the cord attached to the egg acts like a whip, enabling the egg to become attached to blades of grass, (Lincoff(1)). RANGE Cyathus striatus is found in WA, AL, CO, CT, GA, IA, IN, MT, NY, OH, PA, WI, Puerto Rico, and Mexico, (White). It is very widespread in the temperate world, Canada including BC and AB, United States, Mexico, India, China, Japan, (Brodie(1)). It also occurs in Europe (Courtecuisse). The University of British Columbia has collections from BC and Thailand, the University of Washington has collections from WA, IA, and VA, and Oregon State University has collections from OR, OH, and PA.
NEST  commonly 0.7-1cm high, and 0.6-0.8cm wide at top but variable, commonly narrowly obconic, but varying to widely obconic, slender in lower part but flaring outwards in upper third; some shade of brown but varying from gray buff to deep chocolate, brown or deep buff; emplacement distinct; epiphragm [covering membrane] distinct, persistent, usually white, mouth when young with short but distinct setae [bristles]^, (Brodie(1)), 0.8-1cm across, 1-1.5cm high, shaped like a truncated cone or bell; dark reddish brown, grooved lengthwise, interior initially with whitish membrane, (Lincoff(1)), 0.5-1.5cm wide and high, typically with slender base and upper one third flaring outward, but variable; brownish to gray-buff to deep chocolate-brown, (Lincoff(2)), without a stem or with a very short stem, sometimes seated on a brown tufted pad, (McKnight)
OUTER SURFACE  faintly to strongly pleated, irregular shaggy or woolly tomentum, often with some downward pointing hairs, (Brodie(1)), cinnamon-brown to grayish brown or dark brown, (Arora)^, covered with hairs externally, (Lincoff(1)), brownish orange to dark brown; streaked at least near margin, having coarse shaggy hairs, (McKnight)
INNER SURFACE  inside markedly pleated and smooth, shiny, (Brodie(1)), radially grooved, brownish gray, (Courtecuisse)^, lead-colored; shiny, (Lincoff(1), but photo shows brown interior)
EGGS  about 0.2cm, frequently roughly triangular and provided with distinct pale tunica, (Brodie(1)), dark grayish to grayish brown; attached by a strong elastic coiled cord, (McKnight)^, about 0.2cm in diameter, circular, compressed, umbilicate; whitish gray; attached by a white, elastic cord, (Lincoff(1)), flattened and attached by a strong elastic cord, (Phillips), 0.1-0.15cm, dark, attached by coiled cord, (Lincoff(2)) 
EDIBILITY  no (McKnight)
HABITAT  in open woodland on small twigs and woody leaf mould, occasionally in gardens, (Brodie(1)), can grow in manure, but more common on sticks and other vegetable matter, (Arora)^, scattered or in groups on dead wood or vegetable debris in open woods, July to October, (Phillips), on dead wood, bark, twigs, and wood chips, in open woods, (Lincoff(2)), "on decaying plant materials such as wood chips, small branches, and needles", (Trudell)
MICROSCOPIC  spores 18-20 x 8-10 microns, elliptic, slightly narrower at one end, thick-walled, with a notch or apiculus at one end^, (Brodie(1)), 18-22 x 8-12 microns, elliptic, white, (Lincoff(1)), spores 15-22 x 8-12 microns, elliptic, notched at one end, smooth, (Phillips)
NAME ORIGIN  means "with fine grooves and ridges" from Latin "stria" meaning "furrow"^, (Brodie(1))
SIMILAR  Cyathus helenae has tufted tomentum, has faint pleating, lacks setae, and has different habitat, as well as biochemical differences, (Brodie(1)). Spores of C. helenae are similar in size but mostly oval instead of elongate as in C. striatus, (Brodie(2)). Other Cyathus species in the Pacific Northwest are not pleated. See also SIMILAR section of Cyathus olla and Cyathus stercoreus.

ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Nidularia deformis is like Nidularia pulvinata except for the differences in eggs which in N. deformis are lens-shaped, reddish brown, wrinkled when dry and have a cortex composed of thick-walled, separable hyphae that are sparsely branched, (Brodie 1975 as N. farcta). Other features include a small, cup-like, soft fruiting body without an epiphragm, cream to yellowish brown on the outside, eggs that are embedded in a sticky mucilage and lack a funicular cord, and growth on wood.^ (Brodie). Brodie also comments, "It may be precarious to separate the two above entities on the basis of the color of the peridioles: in the material that has been seen, both European and American, there is considerable variation in the shade of brown displayed by the peridioles. The nature of the hyphae of the cortex may prove to be a more reliable criterion for separation. Until further study can be made, the author feels that mycologists must accept Palmer's distinction between these two species, based as it is upon detailed study." RANGE Nidularia deformis is widely distributed (Miller). It has been reported from WA by Buck McAdoo, by Michael Beug, and by Dennis Oliver. It was photographed in ID by Kitt Scates-Barnhart. There are two collections from BC deposited at the University of British Columbia.

NAME ORIGIN  from Latin, meaning "stuffed, solid"
SIMILAR  Nidularia pulvinata has eggs that are irregularly shaped, grayish brown, and rarely wrinkled when dry, with an egg cortex of much branched, thick-walled, densely fused, inseparable hyphae, (Brodie). A third undescribed species may occur in North America that is "macroscopically similar to N. farcta but differs in the cortical hyphae of the peridioles being much branched, which is intermediate between those of N. farcta with simple very sparsely branched hyphae and N. pulvinata with much-branched densely interwoven hyphae", (Palmer in Brodie).

LATIN NAME(S)  Sphaerobolus iowensis  L.B. Walker^  J. Elisha Mitchell scient. Soc. 42(3-4): 171. 1927
ENGLISH NAME(S)  cannon fungus, sphere thrower, artillery fungus
NOTES  Also listed in Puffballs etc. category. Sphaerobolus iowensis L.B. Walker was found to be as common or more common than S. stellatus in North America (Geml et al. Mycologia 2005). The two species must be differentiated microscopically.^ "Early gleba development in young basidiocarps of S. stellatus is marked by the formation of globular knots of binucleate hyphae. These later become centers around which new basidia are formed, eventually producing four (occasionally eight) basidiospores per basidium. The basidia entirely break down and disappear as soon as the spores are mature, making room for the enlargement and maturation of other basidia. In S. iowensis, the development of young basidia is followed by the formation of characteristic cavities or chambers in which the spores are produced (Walker, 1927). In addition, the glebal covering (peridium) consists of a three-layered endoperidium and three-layered exoperidium in S. stellatus, whereas in S. iowensis a gelatinous layer in the outer peridium is absent (Walker, 1927)." (Geml(1) with Latin names italicized). A third North American species of Sphaerobolus, Sphaerobolus ingoldii J. Geml, D.D. Davis & D.M. Geiser, has smaller fruitbodies (rarely exceeding 1-1.5 mm) and peridioles (0.6-1.3 mm), slightly larger spores given as 8.780 +/- 0.761 x 5.874 +/- 0.583 microns and as (7.2)8-9.5(10.2) x (5)5.4-6.2(7.1) microns, no gemmae [asexual propagules borne singly or in chains at the ends of hyphae], and other differences in cultural characteristics. RANGE S. iowensis has been recorded so far from the USA (Georgia, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania) and Japan. (Geml(2)). The distribution of Sphaerobolus iowensis as confirmed by molecular means includes at least IN, MD, MI, NC, NY, OH, and PA, (Geml(1)), and a map in Geml(2) shows additional data points in WA, SC, WI, and WV.

LATIN NAME(S)  Sphaerobolus stellatus  (Tode) Pers.^  Fung. mecklenb. sel. (Lunenburg) 1: 43. (1790)
ENGLISH NAME(S)  cannon fungus, sphere thrower, artillery fungus
NOTES  Also listed in Puffballs etc. category. Sphaerobolus stellatus produces small, white to dull orange spheres growing gregariously on wood, plant debris, or manure, which split into star-like rays exposing the chestnut brown to olive-black egg which is shot out, leaving the translucent whitish receptacle turned inside out. The spore distribution mechanism is remarkable in that the fungus can project its peridioles up to 6 meters, normally toward the brightest light in its environment, hence acquiring the common names "artillery fungus" and "cannonball fungus". In recent years this fungus has attracted attentions because the peridioles are difficult to remove from house siding, windows, and cars.^ Basidiospores are stimulated to germinate in the digestive system of mammals that have ingested them with plant material. If they are not ingested, the asexual spores can germinate directly on wood or plant debris. (Geml(2)). The flight of the "egg" has been measured at 14 feet high and 17 feet long, and light is apparently needed for the trigger mechanism as the flight does not happen in the dark, (Arora). Turning on a light in a dark room may trigger the release of the sphere, (Lincoff(2)). Lincoff(1) notes after describing Sphaerobolus stellatus, "On the basis of size and habitat various similar species have been described which may be considered as varieties of S. stellatus: S. giganteus, reaching 4 mm in diameter; S. solen, with cylindrical carpophores; S. stercorarius, globose, completely buried in droppings of herbivores; S. muscosus, covered with an abundant mycelium; S. brasiliensis, like the above with larger spores, 10-12 x 6-7 microns." In 2005 it was discovered that Sphaerobolus iowensis was as common as or more common than S. stellatus (see NOTES under S. iowensis). S. stellatus is traditionally considered with bird's nests but in Dictionary of the Fungi, 10th Edition, it is assigned to the Geastraceae. RANGE Sphaerobolus stellatus has been reported from BC (P. Kroeger, pers. comm.), WA (D. Oliver, pers. comm.), OR (Zeller(2)), ID (Trueblood(1)), and CA (MykoWeb); it is said to be widely distributed in eastern North America west to MI and TX, (Phillips), and throughout eastern United States, west to MI, OH, IA, LA, (Lincoff(2)); it is said to occur in Europe and North Africa, (Courtecuisse), including the United Kingdom (Palmer(1)); however, some of these records may be Sphaerobolus iowensis and the attached photos could also be S. iowensis. Geml(1) confirmed by molecular means a distribution for Sphaerobolus stellatus including at least AK, MA, MD, MN, PA, and the Netherlands, and a map in Geml(2) shows additional data points in OR, CO, MO, and NC.
NEST  0.1-0.3cm across, at first more or less spherical and "white to dull yellow-orange or ochraceous", the outer wall then splitting into 4-9 bright orange star-like rays, exposing the single spore-containing "egg", "which is then shot out like a cannonball as the entire structure turns inside out (leaving behind a translucent whitish ball perched on the rays)"^, (Arora), at first whitish, becoming more ochraceous and splitting, (Phillips), yellow-orange, flaking and becoming whitish, (Lincoff(2)), whitish or pale yellow; downy then smooth, (Lincoff(1))
