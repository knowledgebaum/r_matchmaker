LATIN NAME(S)  Ascocoryne cylichnium  (Tul.) Korf^  in Phytologia 21: 202. 1971
ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Also listed in Cups category. Ascocoryne cylichnium is not normally considered with Jelly fungi (it is an ascomycete). Features include 1) a top-shaped to disc-shaped or cup-shaped fruitbody that is purple to pink and gelatinous, 2) stem lacking or short, 3) tightly clustered growth on wood, and 4) microscopic characters including ascospores 18-30 microns long that are multiseptate. Breitenbach(1) say it can be separated from Ascocoryne sarcoides only by the spore size^, and gives the same macroscopic description for both species, word for word. RANGE Phillips says "Common. Found in the Pacific Northwest and probably other areas." It is also found in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, (Hansen), and Switzerland, (Breitenbach).
FRUITING BODY  0.5-1(2)cm across, spherical when young then turbinate [top-shaped] to cup-shaped or disc-shaped, or cushion-like with central depression, usually irregularly undulating, spore-bearing surface flesh-pink to violet-pink, smooth to somewhat wrinkled when mature; exterior the same color and smooth; flesh gelatinous; stemless or with very short stem^, (Breitenbach), up to 2cm wide, "lobed or irregularly cup-shaped with a flattened or concave disc; dark reddish brown or purplish brown; moist, slimy, minutely scurfy"; stem none or very short, (Phillips), 0.6-3cm, disc-shaped to turbinate [top-shaped], purplish, (Hansen) 
HABITAT  usually in tight clusters, forming a surface sometimes as large as a hand, rarely single; on rotting branches and trunks of trees on ground, as well as stumps^, (Breitenbach) "clustered on stumps and fallen logs", (Phillips), on old stumps, often among mosses, (Hansen)
MICROSCOPIC  spores 20-24 x 5.5-6 microns, elliptic, smooth, colorless, with several septa when ripe, often with small secondary spores, with droplets when young^; asci 8-spored, 209-220 x 10-12, biseriate, amyloid; paraphyses filiform [thread-like], tips with clavate thickening up to 4 microns, (Breitenbach), spores 18-30 x 4-6 microns, becoming multiseptate and budding off spherical secondary spores while still in the ascus, (Dennis), spores 18-30 x 4-6 microns, fusoid [spindle-shaped], "multiseptate and bud off secondary spores while still in the ascus"; ascus 200-220 x 10-12 microns, (Phillips), spores 18-33 x 4-6 microns, narrowly elliptic, multiseptate, often developing small globose conidia already in the ascus, (Hansen)
NAME ORIGIN  from 'kylichne', Greek for 'small cup'
SIMILAR  Ascocoryne sarcoides has smaller spores 10-19 x 3-5 microns and according to Dennis often has smaller fruiting bodies. See also SIMILAR section of Ascocoryne striata.

ENGLISH NAME(S)  purple jelly-drops
NOTES  Also listed in Cups category. Ascocoryne sarcoides is not normally considered with Jelly fungi (it is an ascomycete). Features include a top-shaped to disc-shaped or cup-shaped fruitbody that is purple to pink and gelatinous, stem that is lacking or short, tightly clustered growth on wood, and microscopic characters including ascospores 10-19 microns long that are nonseptate to 1-septate.^ Breitenbach(1) say it can be separated from Ascocoryne cylichnium only by the spore size, and gives the same macroscopic description for both species, word for word. Breitenbach(1) also say that it is not rarely encountered in its conidial stage which usually differs only insignificantly from the ascus stage, and Dennis says that fruitbodies are almost invariably accompanied by a similarly colored conidial state. RANGE Ascocoryne sarcoides occurs in CA (MykoWeb), throughout North America (Lincoff(2)), ME to OR and probably throughout North America, Europe, and the West Indies, (Seaver). The University of British Columbia has collections from BC and the University of Washington has collections from WA and New Zealand.
FRUITING BODY  0.5-1(2)cm across, spherical when young then turbinate [top-shaped] to cup-shaped or disc-shaped, or cushion-like with central depression, usually irregularly undulating, spore-bearing surface flesh-pink to violet-pink, smooth to somewhat wrinkled when mature; exterior the same color and smooth; flesh gelatinous; stemless or with very short stem^, (Breitenbach), up to 1cm across, cup-shaped, disc concave or flattened, often irregular and lobed; reddish purple; exterior usually minutely scurfy, the same color as upper surface; sessile or short-stemmed, (Dennis), no particular odor or taste (Lincoff(1)), "eventually the cup surface becomes irregular with a distinct dark edge", (Trudell)
HABITAT  usually in tight clusters, forming a surface sometimes as large as a hand, rarely single; on rotting branches and trunks of trees on ground, as well as stumps^, (Breitenbach), clustered on stumps and fallen logs, (Dennis)
MICROSCOPIC  spores 12-16 x 4.5-5 microns, elliptic, smooth, colorless, with single septa when ripe, with two droplets^; asci 8-spored, 114-125 x 8-10, uniseriate to biseriate, amyloid; paraphyses cylindric, forked, with few septa, some rather thickened toward the tips, (Breitenbach), spores 10-19 x 3-5 microns, elliptic to inequilateral, often biseriate, "at first non-septate with 2 oil drops, becoming usually 1-septate, occasionally 3-septate, sometimes germinating within the ascus"; asci 8-spored, up to 160 x 10 microns, cylindric-clavate; paraphyses "slender, often abruptly swollen to 4 microns at the tip", (Dennis), when young may produce only asexual spores (Trudell)
NAME ORIGIN  from Greek meaning "fleshy"^ (Lincoff(1))
SIMILAR  Ascocoryne cylichnium is very similar but often has larger fruitbodies and is distinguished by larger spores 18-30 x 4-6 microns, which become multiseptate and bud off spherical secondary spores while still in the ascus, (Dennis).

ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Also listed in Cups category. Ascocoryne striata is not normally considered with Jelly fungi (it is an ascomycete). It has a gelatinous purplish brown fruitbody on wood, "characterised by the receptacle's striate margin, the occurrence of ampuliform [sic], sigmoid or irregular cells and the presence of oxalate crystals in the ectal excipulum", (Kucera).^ RANGE It is rare, and known from OR and Austria. The two specimens in CUP (Cornell University Plant Pathology Herbarium) under the name Ascocoryne striata (Ellis & Everh.) Korf are different taxa of Ascocoryne (Kucera).
FRUITING BODY  0.2-0.4cm across and 0.1cm high, "cup-shaped to flattened, subsessile, irregularly obconic, gelatinous, distinctly striate when dry"; spore-bearing surface circular, concave, purplish brown with a violaceous tint; margin obtuse
HABITAT  single or in small clusters, on decayed wood
MICROSCOPIC  spores (10)12-14(20) x 3-3.5(6) microns, narrowly elliptic to fusiform, straight or slightly curved, colorless, usually 1-septate, with numerous lipid bodies 0.5-1 micron in diameter, budding ovoid to irregular blastoconidia, 1.5-2 microns^; asci 8-spored, biseriate, 85-150 x 7-10 microns, clavate, slender toward base, apical pore turning blue in Melzer's reagent; paraphyses "narrow, slender or only slightly swollen at the tip, unbranched", terminal cell 12-15 x 1-2 microns; medullary excipulum of textura intricata, up to 650 microns thick, cells 18-45 x 2.5-5 microns, colorless, immersed in a gelatinous matrix; ectal excipulum up to 120 microns thick, of irregularly branched cells and hyphae, individual cells 8-12 x 4-8 microns, ampulliform, fusiform, irregularly curved, somewhat sigmoid, horn-shaped, often slightly swollen, ectal excipulum containing oxalate crystals; anamorph unknown

LATIN NAME(S)  Ascotremella faginea  (Peck) Seaver^  Mycologia 22(2): 53. 1930;  Neobulgaria faginea  (Peck) Raitv.
ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Ascotremella faginea is not normally considered with Jelly fungi (it is an ascomycete). Features include irregularly lobed, pinkish brown to purple brown fruitbodies, growth on hardwood, and microscopic characters including ascospores with longitudinal striations.^ The illustrated collection from Whidbey Island in WA in November is either this species, found at least in eastern North America and Europe, or Neobulgaria pura var. foliacea. Differentiation by longitudinal striations on mature spores and the negative iodine reaction on ascal pore was not possible. The distinction may be moot, because Baral (unpublished comments on Fungi of Switzerland) says that the type of the latter seems to be a mixture of Neobulgaria pura var. pura (with a different form) and Ascotremella faginea. RANGE includes WA
FRUITING BODY  2-4cm across, 1-2cm high, irregularly and lobed fruitbodies "grow crowded together and form a cerebriform gelatinous structure with a short stalklike part for attachment"; pink to violet; shiny when wet, dull when dry, flesh strongly gelatinized and Tremella-like^, (Breitenbach), often about 2cm across, attached by small rudimentary central stem, surface "convex, lobed, and convoluted"; "purplish brown to dull reddish purple"; "flesh highly gelatinized", (Dennis), 2-4cm across, 1-2.5cm high, saucer-shaped to rounded to lobed or brain-like, sometimes forming masses up to 10cm or more; pale pink when young, becoming pinkish brown to reddish purple when old; surface smooth, shiny to dull; consistency rubbery gelatinous, (Bessette)
HABITAT  single, on branches and trunks of Fagus (beech) and Alnus (alder) lying on the ground, June to October^, (Breitenbach), on dead wood of many hardwoods, summer and fall, (Dennis), single, scattered, or in groups on decaying hardwood branches and trunks, especially beech, June to October, (Bessette)
MICROSCOPIC  spores 7-9 x 4-4.5 microns, elliptic, often with truncate ends, colorless, "smooth but with 3 - 4 longitudinal striations which are difficult to see (oil immersion)", with two droplets^; asci 8-spored, 80 x 8 microns, 1-seriate to 2-seriate, iodine negative, (Breitenbach), spores 6-10 x 3.5-4.5 um, elliptic, often with truncate ends, colorless, surface with 3-4 striations visible at one time, usually containing 2 small oil droplets; asci 8-spored, about 70-90 microns, cylindric; paraphyses "slender, obtuse, sometimes forked", (Dennis), spores 7-8.5 x 4-5 microns, "elliptic, often truncate, with 3-4 fine longitudinal striations", colorless, with 2 oil droplets; ascal tips not blue in Melzer's reagent, (Bessette)
NAME ORIGIN  refers to its host Fagus (beech)
SIMILAR  Neobulgaria pura var. foliacea is supposed to 1) have positive iodine reaction on ascal pore, 2) have different construction of cortical layer, and 3) lack longitudinal striations on mature spores, but see NOTES above.

FAMILY  Auriculariaceae, Order Auriculariales, Class Agaricomycetes, Phylum Basidiomycota
LATIN NAME(S)  Auricularia americana  Parmasto & I. Parmasto ex Audet, Boulet & Sirard^  in Boulet, Les Champignons des Arbres de l'Est de l'Amerique du Nord: 287. 2003  group
ENGLISH NAME(S)  tree-ear, wood-ear, brown ear fungus, jelly ear
NOTES  Auricularia americana group fungi grow on wood, producing an ear-shaped to inverted cup-shaped fruitbody which is red-brown, cinnamon, yellow-brown, olive-brown, or blackish brown. Flesh is thin rubbery to flabby-gelatinous. The convex upper sterile surface has a dense, silky covering or is minutely hairy. The concave lower fertile surface is smooth. Both surfaces are often irregularly ribbed and veined.^ The species in the group as considered here correspond to the phylogenetic Auricularia auricula-judae complex. Members of this group include at least two North American members, Auricularia americana (which also grows in Asia) and Auricularia angiospermarum. These two are separated by molecular study and habitat: the former grows on conifer wood and the latter on hardwood. The group also includes the inaptly named European species Auricularia auricula-judae (common in central Europe). A. auricula-judae has larger fruitbodies than A. americana, larger spores, and typically grows on hardwood. According to Wu(1), a fourth species, Auricula heimuer, is likely to have been the taxon reported 2000 years ago in the Chinese medical book "Shennong's Compendium of Materia Medica". It has been cultivated in China for more than 1400 years for its food and medicinal properties. A. heimuer is the center of an industry reported to be producing 4.75 billion kg (fresh weight) in 2013 valued at 4 billion US$ (Wu(1)). The other four known species in the group are Auricularia villosula (China where it is also cultivated by farmers, Russia), Auricularia minutissima (China, Russia), Auricularia tibetica (conifers, Tibet in China), and Auricula minor (Papua-New Guinea). One or more members of this group are said to be edible (Phillips, Lincoff(2)), but one or more members of this group are reported to affect blood coagulation, (Lincoff(2)). The edibility value is more in texture than flavor (Lincoff(1)). RANGE The distribution of Auricularia americana group includes BC, WA, OR, ID, AB, MB, NB, NF, NS, ON, PQ, YT, AL, AK, AR, AZ, CA, CO, CT, FL, GA, IA, IN, KS, KY, LA, MA, MD, ME, MN, MO, MS, MT, NC, NE, NH, NJ, NY, OH, PA, SC, TN, TX, UT, VA, and WV, (Ginns), North America, Europe, and Asia, (Breitenbach), Armenia, Azerbaijan, Estonia, Georgia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Russia, (Raitviir), and Mexico (Lowy). Auricularia americana was examined from MI, WI, China, and Russia; Auricularia angiospermarum was examined from AZ, CT (type), IL, and WI; Auricularia auricula-judae was examined from Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, and Russia (West Caucasus); Auricularia heimuer, A. minutissima, and A. villosula were each examined from China and Russia, Auricula tibetica was examined from Tibet in China, and Auricula minor was examined from Papua New Guinea, (Wu(1)).

HABITAT  limbs and logs with and without bark, slash, on hardwoods and on conifers, associated with a white rot^, (Ginns for North America), single, gregarious to clustered, usually on living, damaged, or dead parts of hardwoods, (Breitenbach), scattered or clustered on conifer logs, usually with bark on, often fir, common in the western mountains, in summer, fall, and winter, especially after heavy rains, (Ammirati), "said to fruit in late summer and fall in western U.S., however, in the Rocky Mts. we commonly find it around melting snowbanks", (McKnight), all year (Buczacki)
MICROSCOPIC  spores 12-14 x 4-6 microns, allantoid, colorless, white in mass; hymenium a dense layer of cylindric-fusiform basidia^, (Martin), spores (12.5)13-15 x (4.5)4.8-5.5(6) microns, allantoid, smooth, colorless, thin-walled, (Wu(1) for A. angiospermarum), spores 17-19 x 6-8 microns, cylindric, slightly curved, smooth, inamyloid, colorless, some with droplets; basidia up to 80 x 7.5 microns, cylindric, with 3 transverse septa, with 3 lateral epibasidia and 1 terminal; cystidia none; hairs on upper side colorless, cylindric, pointed, 80-200 x 5.5-7.5 microns; hyphae gelatinized, branched and some with gnarled outgrowths, 1.5-4 microns across, septa without clamp connections, (Breitenbach)
NAME ORIGIN  from America

Clavulinopsis corniculata is similar and also somewhat tough, but is not viscid, often grows on the ground, and is different microscopically. Ramaria gelatinosa is gelatinous in texture but is much larger and more extensively branched.

ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Colacogloea peniophorae is characterized by cushion-shaped to flat fruitings on the surface of certain fungi, with thin-walled clamped hyphae growing internally in the fungi.^ "Attention was drawn to the occurrence of two distinct types of hymenial conidia...Perhaps two taxa exist or maybe there are two forms of a single species. Conidia in collections from North America are commonly of the paired, blastic type...those in European collections are of the solitary chlamydospore type...Basidiocarps of European collections appear to be distinctly gelatinous, whereas those form North American are predominantly mucoid, the visible mass being composed mainly of slime and conidia", (Oberwinkler 1990). RANGE Colacogloea peniophorae is found in BC and Germany (Oberwinkler), and WA, OR, ON, PQ, AZ, GA, IA, IL, MN, NC, and TN, (Ginns, as Platygloea peniophorae var. peniophorae Bourd. & Galzin).

LATIN NAME(S)  Craterocolla cerasi  (Schumach.) Bref.^  Unters. Gesammtgeb. Mykol. (Liepzig) 7: 98. 1888
ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Features include pinkish, gelatinous-glutinous fruitbodies of various shapes on the shredded inner bark of Populus, on Prunus, and sometimes on other trees. At least on Populus there is a separate, usually prior occurrence of small, non-gelatinous, stemmed, cupulate, conidial apothecia with a membranous stellate enclosure.^ Craterocolla cerasi is common in Ladner, BC: "One thing that should be noted for this species is that the earlier stages generally are discoid anamorphs, small but clustered and conspicuous. This is a well formed, non-gelatinous apothecium with a membranous stellate closure. The basidiocarps often (?always) start to develop from one edge of the anamorph as a flat extension which expands to a single large foliaceous lobe. In mature basidiocarps, several such lobes may be grouped together - I can't tell you whether these all come from one conidioma or from closely situated ones. The lobes are distinctly gelatinous, paler coloured than the cups. The most unusual thing about the habitat is that it frequently occurs on shredded inner bark of Populus, and especially on straps of the bark that have peeled away from large dead branches or trunks, fallen, and lodged on shrubs or even on the ground. It is often growing on dead, intact, fallen bark, on the shredded inner bark. I cannot tell you if it only occurs on suberized material - I have once collected one or two conidiomata on a dead, fallen tree - but growing from the pith. I have searched for it on Prunus but never found it. Nor have I ever found it in the fall or early spring. It occurs only if there has been snow or rain in the winter and if the temperatures have been low (below freezing for some time) prior to the development of the fungus." (R. Bandoni, pers. comm.). RANGE C. cerasi occurs in BC and also elsewhere including Switzerland in Europe (Breitenbach(2) from which the following description is derived).
FRUITING BODY  1-4(5)cm across, "variously formed, spread out flat and irregularly rounded, cerebriform, mesenterylike, or weakly cup-shaped, but also short-stalked and then plate-shaped and lobed, appressed tightly to the substrate and punctiform"; "upper surface smooth, gelatinous-glutinous, ocher-pink, gray-ocherish to salmon-colored"; consistency "somewhat tough, gelatinous, soft"; pycnidial form "turbinate, deeply urceolate, concolorous"
HABITAT  single or gregarious on dead trunks (standing and fallen) and branches of Prunus avium (wild cherry), according to literature also on other Prunus spp., Alnus (alder), Populus (poplar), and Picea (spruce), fall to spring, (Breitenbach for Europe), common on trapped, shredded inner bark of Populus trichocarpa, mid-winter to early spring, (R. Bandoni for Ladner, BC, pers. comm.)

NAME ORIGIN  means 'less'
SIMILAR  Dacrymyces stillatus has spores that are thick-walled with thick septa, and possesses an arthrospore state, (McNabb). Fruitbodies of D. stillatus are also larger (Reid). Dacrymyces tortus grows on conifers and has conspicuous clamp connections, (Brasfield(2)). Dacrymyces capitatus in typical condition has 1) larger erumpent fruitbodies, 2) a rooting base or short stem, and 3) less allantoid spores with both thin walls and septa, (Reid). Dacrymyces minutus is even smaller and is sometimes irregular in shape, but spores are larger.

NOTES  {See also Dacrymyces Table.} Dacrymyces ovisporus is unique among dacrymycetaceous fungi in that its spores are broadly oval (rather than cylindric or allantoid) and muriform (with septa in more than one plane) (Bandoni 1963). Fruiting bodies are orange when fresh and convoluted with a small rooting base.^ RANGE It is found in BC, (Bandoni), Germany and Sweden, (McNabb), Finland, Norway, and United Kingdom, (in Reid), and Estonia (Raitviir).
FRUITING BODY  0.2-0.5cm in diameter, to 0.4cm high, pustulate, convoluted, firm-gelatinous, attached to substrate by small rooting base; orange when fresh, drying dark amber to dark brown^, (McNabb), 0.2-0.5cm in diameter, firm-gelatinous; pale orange, drying dark brown and conspicuous, pustulate and convoluted; rooting in wood, (Kennedy), up to 0.4cm high, consisting of short, stout, pallid stem-like base up to 2cm high [sic], expanding above into an orange head up to 0.5cm wide, "which is thrown into gyrose lobes and folds, resembling in miniature the fruitbodies of Tremella mesenterica", (Reid), spore deposit white (Buczacki)

ENGLISH NAME(S)  common jelly-spot
NOTES  {See also Dacrymyces Table.} Fruitbodies are orange to light yellow, and cushion-shaped to cup-shaped or slightly convoluted. Characteristic features are the presence of arthrospores in chains (spores derived from the disarticulation of a vegetative branch), thickened spore walls, size and 3-septa of basidiospores, and clampless hyphae, (Breitenbach 1986). In collections where arthrospores are absent D. stillatus can be distinguished by the 3-septate spores with thickened walls and septa, absence of conspicuous dikaryophyses, and lack of clamp connections, (McNabb 1973).^ "Often two forms appear together in same habitat, namely the lighter and yellower basidiospore-producing form and the darker, orange one which produces arthrospores (oidia)", (Breitenbach). Thick walls and septa of spores seem to be an inconstant feature since it may vary considerably in spores from different fruitbodies in the same collection, it also seems that septation occurs after discharge and prior to germination while the spores are trapped on the surface of the fruitbody, as 3-septation was not in a yellow spore deposit, (Reid). There are many collections from BC at the University of British Columbia. RANGE Distribution includes WA, OR, ID, NF, NS, NT, ON, AK, AL, AZ, CA, CO, GA, IA, LA, MO, NC, NJ, NY, OH, SC, TX, VT, and WI, (Ginns), Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, (McNabb who says it is generally common), Panama, Bolivia, and also reported from Japan and South Georgia of Antarctica, (Reid), and USSR throughout (Raitviir). The records of Martin and Lowy are dubious since they report clamp connections, (Reid).
FRUITING BODY  0.1-1.5cm across, cushion-like, knob-shaped, lens-shaped, cup-shaped, or plate-shaped, with a stem-like attachment in center, "flesh gelatinous-elastic and more or less translucent, deliquescing into a slimy mass when old"; "orange to light yellow, more rarely almost white, dark orange when dry": smooth to undulating-wrinkled, sometimes also slightly cerebriform [brain-shaped]^, (Breitenbach), 0.1-0.4cm in diameter, occasionally coalescing to form masses up to 2cm in extent, pustulate, convolute or brain-like, sometimes flattened discoid and smooth or slightly convoluted; gelatinous; attached to substrate by a point; yellow to orange-yellow when fresh, drying yellow-brown to red-brown; arthrospore-bearing fructifications hemispheric, irregular, or tuberculate, soft-gelatinous to waxy-gelatinous, bright orange or reddish orange when fresh, opaque, drying dark red-orange, (McNabb), 0.1-0.4cm, up to 0.35cm tall, flat-turbinate; watery orange to amber, drying reddish brown and more or less pezizoid, (Martin), "sexual form is usually watery gelatinous to firm, yellow, orange, or reddish orange, sometimes with a short stipe and rather small and cushion-shaped, but sometimes forming larger confluent masses" - it produces sexual spores; asexual form rather soft, dark orange or reddish orange, and produces asexual spores, (Trudell), spore deposit white (Buczacki)
HABITAT  on conifer wood, less often hardwood^, found on logs, old railroad ties, causes a brown rot, (Ginns), single, gregarious, or coalescing together to form large groups, on dead hardwood or conifer wood, with or without bark, throughout year but conspicuous only in wet periods, (Breitenbach), all year; including structural timber, (Buczacki)
MICROSCOPIC  spores 14-17 x 5-6 microns, elliptic-cylindric, slightly curved, smooth, inamyloid, thick-walled, colorless, with 3 septa when mature^, also arthrospores (oidia) 9-12(16) x 3-4 microns, in chains, colorless; basidia up to 50 microns, fork-shaped; cystidia not seen; hyphae 2-3 microns wide, without clamp connections, (Breitenbach), spores (9)10.5-16(17.5) x 3.5-6 microns, "curved cylindrical, occasionally ovate to subpyriform, becoming thick-walled with thick septa, tinted, apiculate", becoming 3-(4)-septate at maturity, germination by colorless, spherical to nearly spherical conidia and/or by germ tubes; probasidia 25-53 x 3-4.5 microns, cylindric-subclavate, with basal septa, becoming bifurcate; hymenium consisting of basidia and occasionally simple, cylindric dikaryophyses; internal hyphae thin-walled, smooth or roughened, septate, clamp connections absent; clamp connections not seen in any specimens by McNabb and Kennedy, but presence recorded by Brasfield, Martin and Olive; outer layers of arthrospore stage composed of chains of arthrospores, (1)-2-celled, 8-16 x 2.5-5.5 microns, arthrospores often present in separate fruitings or occasionally mixed with basidia, (McNabb), spores 15-25 x 6-9 microns, plump-allantoid, becoming 3-7(9)-septate, and producing subspherical to ovoid conidia up to 4 x 2.5 microns, (Martin)
NAME ORIGIN  from 'stilla', Latin for 'drop'
SIMILAR  Dacrymyces tortus has clamped paraphyses and narrower spores, (Brasfield(2)). Dacrymyces capitatus a has short substantial stem and somewhat smaller and thin-walled spores, (Breitenbach).

ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Ditiola radicata is characterized by rooting fruiting bodies with different microscopic structure in the cap and the stout stem, and tardily 1(2)-septate spores. Young fruiting bodies are often covered by a white "veil" before the spore-bearing surface develops. The orange, tough-gelatinous cap is shallow cup-shaped to convoluted and the stem whitish and cylindric. (McNabb 1966).^ This description is for var. radicata: a var. gyrocephala is distinguished by a more prominent stem, normally darker color, and 3-septate spores, (McNabb). RANGE Var. radicata is found in BC, AB, NS, ON, AZ, CA, GA, IA, MA, MD, NC, NH, NY, OH, and VT, (Ginns), and British Isles, Finland, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland, (McNabb). Var. gyrocephala is found in NS, ON, LA, MA, ME, MN, MS, NJ, NY, and SC, (Ginns). D. radicata also found in Estonia and Russia, (Raitviir), and the United Kingdom (Reid, who notes that Lowy collections are suspect because they are said to have clamp connections).
FRUITING BODY  up to 0.7cm high, at first cylindric, turbinate [top-shaped], or piston-shaped, becoming stoutly stemmed and capped, occasionally with two or more caps on common stem, cap 0.2-0.5cm in diameter, shallow cup-shaped or inflated and gyrose, stem cylindric, even, stout, 0.2-0.4cm x 0.1-0.2cm, prolonged basally into a simple or forked root, consistency of fruiting body tough-gelatinous; cap orange when fresh, drying dark orange brown, stem dingy white or cream, drying pallid tan; stem somewhat tomentose^, (McNabb), up to 0.3(0.4-0.5)cm, at first small hemispheric pustules, but soon relatively thick and disc-shaped with shallow central depression, or barrel-shaped, cup-shaped, or cylindric, with an apical depression, but finally turbinate [top-shaped] with a flattened, smooth or wrinkled disc up to 0.25cm across; "orange when fresh becoming orange-brown when dry, but when young appearing almost hoary due to a covering of a minute scurfy-pruinose tomentum"; stem 0.25-0.4cm x 0.1-0.2cm, covered with a whitish cream felt-like tomentum, expanding in upper part into disc and strongly rooting in lower part, in some case fruitbodies may branch from a common base, (Reid), spore deposit yellow (Buczacki)
HABITAT  conifer wood and hardwood^, fallen limbs with bark, usually barkless wood, associated with a brown rot, Abies balsamea, Betula spp., Pinus sp., Pinus contorta, Quercus sp. Quercus coccinea, cedar, (Ginns), gregarious on conifer wood, (McNabb), all year (Buczacki)
MICROSCOPIC  spores (8.5)10-13(14.5) x 3.5-4.5(5) microns, cylindric to slightly curved-cylindric, thin-walled with thin septa, tinted, apiculate, tardily 1(2)-septate at maturity^, germination by germ tubes, occasionally by conidia; probasidia 33-50 x 3.5-5 microns, cylindric-subclavate, with basal septa, becoming bifurcate; hymenium "amphigenous, composed of basidia and occasionally simple, cylindric dikaryophyses"; structure of cap and stem are different: cap "composed of thin-walled, septate, branched hyphae of smaller diameter" [than those in stem] "loosely arranged", stem "composed of thick-walled, sparingly septate and typically unbranched hyphae lying more or less parallel and projecting into the pileus"; clamp connections absent from all hyphae; hairs on stem thick-walled, roughened, septate, with terminal cells often slightly inflated, (McNabb), spores 8.0-9.75 x 3.75-4.0 microns, elliptic, none seen with septa, (Reid)
NAME ORIGIN  means 'with a root'
SIMILAR  Ditiola radicata may be confused with stemmed species of Dacrymyces, but is readily distinguished microscopically by the difference in structure of cap and stem, (McNabb). Dacrymyces capitatus is very similar when immature, because the heterogeneous internal structure of Ditiola radicata does not become evident until late in development: the only sure way of distinguishing these is to ensure that one has mature fruiting bodies while checking the internal structure, and the septation of the spores: those of Ditiola radicata are tardily 1-(2-)septate, and those of Dacrymyces capitatus are 3-septate with the septa often thickened, (Reid).

NOTES  Exidia candida produces fruitbodies with brain-like lobes, that are translucent whitish or grayish, typically with orange or brown areas.^ RANGE It is found in BC, WA, ID, NWT, NY, and PA, (Ginns). Collections were examined from BC, WA, ID, NS, and ON, and the distribution is probably throughout the northern United States and Canada, (Klett).
FRUITING BODY  arising as colorless pustules, "expanding and becoming appressed-discoid or almost immediately anastomosing to form expanded masses" up to 10cm or more, most often broadly attached; grayish hyaline to whitish to cream to grayish orange to cinnamon to vinaceous russet, very often with more than one of these colors on one fruitbody; outer surface undulate to alveolate to cerebriform [brain-like], occasionally lobed, with or without light colored or whitish papillae up to 0.5 microns long; undersurface appressed or free, occasionally with strands of hyphae contacting the substrate; margin "free, undulate to incised, often appearing ciliate by the long papillae"; sterile fruitbodies frequent^, (Klett), "Applanate, white with grayish, cerebriform lobes", (Lloyd)
HABITAT  found on Acer macrophyllum (big-leaf maple), Alnus rubra (red alder), Betula sp., Betula glandulosa, Corylus sp., Corylus californica, Corylus cornuta^, (Ginns), Alnus (alder), Betula (birch), and Prunus, (Klett)

NAME ORIGIN  means "white"
SIMILAR  Exidia alba of eastern North America is similar but has different spores, (Lloyd). "Non-papillate, unicolored collections of Exidia candida are often difficult to separate from E. repanda. Perhaps the best criteria in these instances are the hypobasidia, basidiospores, and attachment to the substratum. The hypobasidia or E. candida are ellipsoidal to obovate to obpyriform and often stalked, whereas those of E. repanda are ellipsoidal without a stalk. The basidiospores of E. candida are most frequently 4.5 microns in diameter, while those of Exidia repanda generally appear slimmer in outline with the average diameter being from 3-3.5 microns. In most cases, the basidiocarps of E. candida are broadly attached, while those of E. repanda have a narrow, short, stipe-like point of attachment."

NOTES  Exidia glandulosa produces blackish gelatinous fruitbodies, forming fused masses of blister-like to cushion-like to brain-like components, with a smooth or warted surface (use a hand lens). Exidia nigricans (With.) P. Roberts, Mycotaxon 109: 220 (2009) has been regarded as a synonym but there is some molecular evidence that it is distinct. E. nigricans is said to produce  button-shaped fruitbodies about 2cm across in clusters that quickly coalesce to form, irregular masses 10cm or more across, whereas E. glandulosa produces discrete, top-shaped fruitbodies that rarely if ever coalesce (wikipedia article on E. nigricans accessed April 16, 2016).^ RANGE Klett(2) separates Exidia glandulosa forma populi Neuhoff as Exidia populi nom. prov. and assigns collections to it from WA, ID, AK, CT, and MN and to Exidia glandulosa from BC, ON, PQ, AZ, CA, IA, LA, MA, MI, MS, NH, NY, SC, and Russia, (Klett). The distribution of Exidia glandulosa includes BC, WA, OR, ID, MB, NB, NF, NS, ON, PE, PQ, YT, AK, AZ, CA, CO, FL, GA, LA, MD, MN, MI, MS, NC, NH, NY, OH, and WI, (Ginns), North America, Europe, and Asia, (Breitenbach), Mexico and Brazil, (Lowy), and the Soviet Union throughout (Raitviir).
FRUITING BODY  1-2cm wide, but often fusing with others to form rows or masses up to 50cm across, "beginning as a pallid or translucent blister but soon becoming cushion-shaped to irregularly lobed; reddish-black to olive-black soon becoming jet-black (or black from the beginning)"; upper surface "smooth to minutely roughened or warty"; consistency flabby and gelatinous; stem absent^, (Arora), 10-30cm expanses 0.5-1.5cm thick, upper spore-bearing surface cerebriform (brain-like) with undulating folds, margin sharply bounded and not attached to substrate, flesh gelatinous and soft, when dried forms a thin (0.1cm) black shiny membrane on substrate; fruiting body black to brown-black; upper surface punctate with glandular warts, elsewhere smooth and when fresh shiny but otherwise dull and often white-pruinose, (Breitenbach), attaining 20cm or more in the longest dimension, at first colorless, "pustulate, immediately spreading and anastomosing and becoming broadly effused, thick-tuberculate or erumpent and blackish-brown", drying black, spore-bearing surface sparsely or sometimes rather thickly dotted with wart-like papillae, (Martin), no odor or flavor (Lincoff(1)), spore deposit white (Buczacki)
HABITAT  "scattered to densely gregarious or in fused rows and masses on rotting hardwood logs and branches"^, (Arora), on dead hardwood, on the cut surfaces of stumps, as well as on branches on the ground, more rarely on wounded parts of living trees, (Breitenbach), on hardwood, rarely conifer wood: bark, dead branches of live trees, fallen branches, limbs, slash, associated with a white rot, (Ginns), dead hardwood of all sorts, particularly hickory and oak, reported rarely on coniferous wood, (Martin), April to May and November to January (Lincoff(2)), all year (Buczacki)
MICROSCOPIC  spores 12-14 x 4.5-5 microns, cylindric, +/- allantoid [curved sausage-shaped], smooth, inamyloid, colorless, sometimes with droplets^; hypobasidia 16-18 x 8-9 microns, oval, pyriform [pear-shaped], longitudinally septate, with 4 epibasidia; hyphae 1-1.5 microns wide, septa with clamp connections, gelatinized, (Breitenbach), spores 10-16 x 4-5 microns, allantoid, colorless, white in mass; probasidia 10-16 x 7-13 microns, ovate or elliptic, colorless or brownish, becoming cruciate-septate, (Martin), spores 10-16 x 3-5 microns, sausage-shaped, smooth; spore deposit whitish (Arora)
NAME ORIGIN  from Latin meaning "full of glands" because of the shape of the hymenium^, (Lincoff(1))
SIMILAR  Exidia nigricans is almost indistinguishable based on macro and micro morphology, "but according to a recent study is widespread in North America and is often misidentified as E. glandulosa", (Siegel(2) with Latin name italicized). E. nigricans may be the correct name for what is commonly called E. glandulosa but will coalesce into one big mass (unlike E. glandulosa), (D. Miller, pers. comm.). |Exidia recisa has a small stem and becomes yellowish brown, (Lincoff). E. recisa has lighter colors (yellowish brown to dark brown as opposed to brownish black to grayish yellowish brown), is more erect, has a very short stem-like base, and lacks the warty surface (McKnight). |Exidia glandulosa forma populi differs primarily in macroscopic characters: it has the inferior surface appressed but free (as opposed to almost entirely adherent to the substrate), and grayish to grayish granulose, and this form lacks surface papillae (it is smooth to finely asperulate and if occasional wart-like structures are found, they are composed of crystals, covered or not by the dikaryophyses), (Klett who uses the provisional combination Exidia populi). |See also SIMILAR section of Bulgaria inquinans and Exidia zelleri.

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Exidia umbrinella is similar in form and color to Exidia recisa when fresh, but E. umbrinella has smaller spores and basidia, and when dry it turns black, but not shining as in E. recisa, (Bresadola). Exidia crenata [which Klett(2) regards as the name to be used for some collections attributed to E. recisa] is larger, more undulate-costate, and more cespitose, (Bresadola). A somewhat similar taxon occurs on spruce and pine wood. Klett (1964) provisionally identifies this as Exidia pinicola (Peck) Coker. The collections he assigns here had mostly been identified as Exidia saccharina, or in two cases as Exidia umbrinella. Basidiocarps are at first pustulate, about 4 mm, becoming disc-shaped with a single point of attachment, then broadly expanded and appressed, anastomosing into large clusters that are ridged to brain-like, smooth or occasionally bearing crystalline warts. Color is light watery yellow at first becoming grayish orange to reddish brown. Spores are 10-15 x (3.5)4-5 um, curved-cylindrical to bent-cylindrical, basidia 2-4 celled by longitudinal septa, and clamp connections conspicuous.

NOTES  Phaeotremella foliacea produces a large brownish convoluted mass of wavy or leaf-like, brown, gelatinous folds. It is parasitic on Stereum sanguinolentum and apparently limited to conifer wood.^ Tremella frondosa and Tremella foliacea have been considered synonyms by some authors and at least 12 different publication have discussed the question, sometimes using different concepts for Tremella frondosa. Original type material did not survive, and Spirin(1) selected lectotypes and epitypes based on clues in the early descriptions, prior discussions in the literature, and molecular-backed knowledge of current species. They assembled evidence to support separating Phaeotremella foliacea (growing on conifers associated with Stereum sanguinolentum) from Phaeotremella frondosa (growing on hardwoods associated with other Stereum species), and from four other species of Phaeotremella growing outside North America. In addition to the host differences, the spores of P. frondosa average larger, but the variation range in both species is wide, so that "basidiospore size only is not a stable character to distinguish these two species". The description of Spirin(1) is sparse, so that earlier North American descriptions, probably encompassing Tremella frondosa as well as T. foliacea, are left to provide some extra detail. The current name of Tremella foliacea Pers. in the online Species Fungorum, accessed February 26, 2018 is Phaeotremella foliacea (Pers.) Wedin, J.C. Zamora & Millanes, but MycoBank, accessed the same day, gave the current name as Phaeotremella pseudofoliacea Rea. On the other hand Spirin(1) synonymize P. pseudofoliacea with P. frondosa. RANGE In the Pacific Northwest, Tremella foliacea has often been reported growing on conifers - these would be Phaeotremella foliacea in the newer restricted sense of Spirin(1). There are collections from conifer wood at the University of British Columbia from BC and WA and a collection at Oregon State University from conifer branches in OR.
FRUITING BODY  2.5-20cm wide or more, "typically a complicated mass of wavy or leaflike folds, lobes, and convolutions; reddish-cinnamon to brown, vinaceous-brown, or tinged purple", often paler when wet; "flabby or gelatinous when moist, bone-hard when dry"; no stem^, (Arora), 1-3cm high, 1-5cm across, brown, darkening (but not blackening) in herbarium specimens, (Spirin), foliaceous, reddish brown to purplish or blackish brown, (McKnight), 3-12cm in greatest dimension, "firm-gelatinous, with numerous thin, leaf-like folds fertile on both sides; cinnamon-brown with flesh tints, drying blackish brown", (Martin), "typically some shade of brown, sometimes blackish brown, often with a violet or reddish orange cast", (Trudell)
HABITAT  dead twigs, branches, logs, stumps^, (Ginns(5) who includes P. frondosa), conifer wood only (Spirin), usually appears late in the season, (Lincoff who probably included P. frondosa)
MICROSCOPIC  spores (5.2)5.3-9.1(10.2) x (4.6)4.7-8.5(9.5) microns, broadly elliptic to nearly round, colorless to brownish^; basidia 4-spored, 12-18 x 10-14 microns, "ovoid to subglobose", "slightly thick-walled", with colorless or brownish content; swollen cells "often present on basal lobes, broadly ellipsoid to globose, slightly to very thick-walled", up to 25 microns in diam, producing conidial cells, 4-10 x 3-7 microns, elliptic or nearly round; clamp connections present, (Spirin), spores 8-9(13) x 7-9 microns, ovate to round, germinating by repetition; hymenial conidia lacking; probasidia 12-16 x 10-14 microns, broadly elliptic to nearly spherical, becoming cruciate-septate, (Martin), spores 7-9(13) x 6-9 microns, round to broadly elliptic, smooth, spore deposit white to yellowish, (Arora), spores form on outer surfaces (Lincoff)
NAME ORIGIN  means 'leafy'
SIMILAR  Phaeotremella frondosa grows on hardwood in association with different Stereum spp. Tremella encephala is somewhat similar but smaller and flesh-colored to brownish (Arora). Auricularia auricula is cup-like or ear-like (never that shape in Phaeotremella foliacea) and more gelatinous.

In addition to the host differences, the spores of P. frondosa average larger, but the variation range in both species is wide, so that "basidiospore size only is not a stable character to distinguish these two species". The description below is derived from the sparse description by Spirin(1) - refer to earlier North American descriptions of Phaeotremella foliacea, included under that species to provide some extra detail. Note that Spirin's size for fruitbodies of Phaeotremella frondosa is larger than for P. foliacea, but collections that must be assigned to one or the other reach much larger sizes than given here. RANGE Tremella foliacea has been reported on hardwoods (for instance Kauffman(5) from OR as T. foliosa, a record also included in Ginns(5)). There are hardwood records labeled Tremella foliacea from BC at the University of British Columbia, from OR at Oregon State University, and from WA at the University of Washington. Such hardwood records probably represent Phaeotremella frondosa as defined by Spirin(1). According to Spirin(1), the verified records so far come only from BC (R. Bandoni's collections).  
FRUITING BODY  1-5cm high, 1-7cm across, ochraceous-brown to dark brown, darkening (sometimes blackening) in herbarium specimens; foliaceous, often fusing together, lobes arising from a common base, "entire, rotund, even to undulate", up to 2cm wide^, (Spirin), presumably reaches much larger dimensions (see older P. foliacea descriptions under that species - Spirin(1) dimensions for P. foliacea are even smaller)

NOTES  The tiny gregarious gelatinous fruitbodies grow on the spore-bearing surface of Aleurodiscus.^ Phaeotremella mycetophiloides "apparently occurs throughout most of the range of hosts Aleurodiscus amorphus and Aleurodiscus grantii, although it may be lacking at higher altitudes tolerated by the host", (Bandoni(7)). The description is derived from Bandoni(7). Collections in western Canada often bear conidia only, although this may reflect developmental sequence and collecting times. RANGE Collections were examined from BC, AB, MB, NB, NS, ON, PQ, SK, NC, Germany, Japan, and Korea, that there are reports from Austria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and eastern Russia. (Bandoni(7))
FRUITING BODY  at first resembling liquid droplets, enlarging, the individual fruiting bodies 0.01-0.15cm in diameter, typically gregarious, often anastomosing, extending up to 1.5cm if anastomosis is between fruiting bodies on adjacent host fruiting bodies, "mostly hemispherical or somewhat discoid, smooth to slightly wrinkled or cerebriform owing to both coalescence and formation of minute surface irregularities, gelatinous"; at first colorless to milky, milky to very pale pink or yellow when young, colorless to dark brown (near "warm sepia" (Ridgway)), horny when dry, very young fruiting bodies visible only as discolored indentations of the host spore-bearing surface when dry
HABITAT  typically gregarious, on spore-bearing surface of Aleurodiscus amorphus, and Aleurodiscus grantii, "which predominantly occur on dead branches in live trees of Abies spp. and infrequently on species of Picea, Pinus, Pseudotsuga, and Tsuga"
MICROSCOPIC  spores (basidiospores) (7.0)8.0-12.5 x (7.0)8.0-10.0 microns, nearly round to apiculate-ovate or bullate [probably bulliform], germinating by repetition or by budding, conidia regularly present, intermixed with basidia or often alone in the hymenium, 5.0-9.5 x 3.0-5.0(6.5) microns, variable, nearly round, elliptic, teardrop-shaped, or subcylindric, sometimes peanut-shaped^, "often bearing a clamp vestige, sometimes germinating by budding"; probasidia 15-21(28) x (11)14-18 microns, "subglobose to ellipsoid, infrequently globose, 4-celled when mature", epibasidia "from 9-140 x 2-3 microns, shortest ones almost conical and up to 6 microns wide, others swollen to 3.5-6.0 microns below the apex"; hyphal compartments subtending basidia often inflated, their diameter often approaching that of the basidia they bear; context hyphae "radiating outward from the host surface, mostly swollen in the vicinity of the septa and abruptly narrowed a short distance from the clamp, 1.5-3.5 microns in diam at the internodes, 5.0-6.5 microns at the nodes; clamp connections abundant; haustorial branches abundant in the context and hymenium, frequently abundant around (and attached to) host basidiospores that have landed on the hymenium, haustorial mother cells 4.0-5.0(-7.5) x 2.5-3.5 microns, the filaments up to 48 x 1-2 microns, usually irregular and sometimes branched"
NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Phaeotremella simplex (found in eastern North America and Europe) is similar, and both can occur on Aleurodiscus amorphus (as well as A. thujae for simplex and A. grantii for P. mycetophiloides), but P. simplex differs in having 2-celled basidia and in lacking clamp connections.

NAME ORIGIN  means 'with various colors'
SIMILAR  Tremella subencephala is superficially similar to T. versicolor but the host is different and they are microscopically distinct: 1) the basidia are smaller and they lack the basal stalk and swollen base that are common in T. versicolor, 2) the conidia are released singly rather than in clusters as in T. versicolor, and individual conidia differ morphologically.

NOTES  Also listed in Cups category. Features include large black highly gelatinous fruitbodies that are top-shaped to cup-shaped, short gelatinous stem, growth particularly in spring on wood and duff under conifers, and microscopic characters.^ Although this was described as Sarcosoma mexicana (using a feminine form for the adjective), "soma" is a neuter Greek noun and should use the neuter form of the adjective, "mexicanum". Carbone(2) call this species Urnula padeniana M. Carbone, Agnello, A.D. Parker & P. Alvarado and consider the name Sarcosoma mexicanum (Ellis & Holw.) Paden & Tylutki to be misapplied. RANGE Urnula padeniana is found at least in BC, WA, OR, and ID, (Larsen), WA, OR, CA, Mexico, and India, (Castellano), and Mexico to BC, (Paden).
FRUITING BODY  5-10(20)cm across and 3-10(15)cm high, sometimes cup-shaped but often more or less top-shaped, margin often lobed; spore-bearing upper surface black or sometimes dark brown; underside dark gray to black; finely velvety, especially in upper part; flesh rubbery overall; interior flesh a watery-gelatinous mass, clear gray to black or brownish; fruitbody usually narrowed in lower part to from a thick stem "which is often deeply wrinkled or ribbed or has large pockets"^, (Arora), fruitbody up to 9cm across and high, at first turbinate [top-shaped] becoming discoid; spore-bearing upper surface more or less flat to moderately concave, black; margin raised, entire; underside dark gray to black, often deeply wrinkled, especially in lower part, covered with an extensive dark tomentum; with a short gelatinous stem, (Paden), up to 11cm across, wedge-shaped [top-shaped]; spore-bearing upper surface black; underside black with heavily pigmented hairs; flesh thick, when old becoming thinner from collapse of the gelatinous interior; substipitate, (Castellano), underside often roughened with dark granules (Phillips)

NAME ORIGIN  in honor of the American mycologist, John Wilburn Paden, the major researcher who treated this species
SIMILAR  Sarcosoma latahense is smaller (2-7.5cm across), purple-brown to black, grows particularly at high elevations, and spores lack oil droplets at maturity, (Arora). S. latahense has usually smaller fruitbodies, has spores that lack oil droplets, and has tomentum hyphae that are smooth except for occasional dark granules and usually light in color, (Paden). S. latahense is smaller (up to about 4cm instead of up to 10cm), "less gelatinous, with the gelatin diminishing greatly as the fruitbodies age", the cups "with a gray, rather than black, exterior", and has spores 24-37 x 9-12 microns and lacking oil droplets at maturity, (Trudell).
