NOTES  {See also Hericium Table.} Hericium erinaceus forms an unbranched mass of long, closely packed, parallel hanging white spines that discolor to yellowish or yellowish brown, growing on hardwoods. The dried and ground flesh is used as a styptic by some people according to Lincoff (1981).^ Note that the ending of "erinaceus" is masculine even though Hericium is neuter, because "erinaceus" is a noun, not an adjective. RANGE It is found in WA (Hall), CA (Arora), OR, AL, AR, AZ, FL, GA, IA, KS, LA, MD, MI, MN, MS, NC, NJ, NY, PA, VA, and WV, (Ginns), There are collections from BC deposited at the Pacific Forestry Centre and the University of British Columbia. It also occurs in Europe and Russia (Siberia), (Coker).

ENGLISH NAME(S)  orange rough-cap tooth, orange Hydnellum, orange spine, orange tooth
NOTES  Features include 1) a tough top-shaped fruiting body with a knobby or lumpy cap surface that is whitish when young or on the actively growing margin but otherwise orange to rusty cinnamon, 2) flesh that is orange to rusty-cinnamon and corky except for a thin upper spongy layer on cap, 3) short, blunt, whitish teeth, 4) orange to rusty cinnamon stem, 5) mild to faintly fragrant odor, and 6) bitter to farinaceous taste. Hydnellum aurantiacum, (and probably also H. peckii), have been reported to associate with the myco-heterotrophic plant Hemitomes congestum (gnome plant), according to Trudell(2003).^ The H. aurantiacum complex includes also H. conigenum, H. complectipes, and H. auratile; however, Harrison(3) describes H. conigenum as common in the Pacific Northwest and Harrison(4) does not include the other two in the list of North American Hydnellum species known to them, whereas Hall includes only the second and third for WA. Because Harrison(3) points out the similarity between H. conigenum and H. auratile of Europe, the two names could be referring to the same taxon in the Pacific Northwest. Hall(3) describe two varieties besides the type variety, 1) var. bulbipodium with abruptly bulbous stem thickened by a spongy layer, with brownish orange or brownish red cap and tawny to orange margin, depressed to funnel-shaped with thin cap flesh, some with one or two proliferating caps, with tomentum agglutinating into prominent radiating ridges, and spines that are brown at the bases, and 2) var. colliculosum, with dingy brownish orange cap (brighter than var. bulbipodium but less bright than var. aurantiacum) and yellowish orange margin but without bulbous stem, radiating ridges if present not prominent, nodules not present on cap, and flesh not as thin as in var. bulbipodium, teeth also with brownish bases. Hall's description below is for the type variety; for the other descriptions the variety is not specified. RANGE H. aurantiacum is found in FL, NC, NY, and RI, and reported throughout the United States and Canada from NS to FL, (Coker). It is found at least in WA (Hall), CA (Arora), CO (Lincoff), under conifers in Europe and North America generally, (Harrison(3)), and also occurs in Asia (Trudell(4)). There are collections from BC deposited at the Pacific Forestry Centre including some determined by K.A. Harrison. There are collections from OR deposited at Oregon State University. The University of Washington also has collections from AK.

LATIN NAME(S)  Hydnellum auratile  (Britzelm.) Maas Geest.^  Persoonia 1: 111. 1959
ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Hydnellum auratile is a member of the H. aurantiacum complex and brighter orange with smaller spores than the other Pacific Northwest members (H. aurantiacum and H. complectipes). Its features include 1) a depressed to funnel-shaped, orange brown cap with paler margin, sometimes zoned by color, the surface tomentose then with radiating ridges, and sometimes scrobiculate or with excrescences, 2) orange fibrous woody flesh that is not zoned in the cap, (stem flesh duplex), 3) light orange teeth that become two-colored, 4) an orangish stem with a slightly swollen base, 5) moldy odor and taste, and 6) relatively small, nearly round spores.^ Note that this species is not included by Harrison & Grund in their 1987 key (Harrison(4)) that includes species known to them from North America: Hall disagrees with Maas Geesteranus's view that this is a purely European species on the basis that the latter's claim (that North American collections have the incorrect context color and immature spine color) does not hold for the Washington collections. On the other hand, Hall does not mention H. conigenum which Harrison(3) describes as common in the Pacific Northwest, and it is possible that H. conigenum and H. auratile are used by the different authors to refer to the same Pacific Northwest taxon. In this connection it is interesting that Franklin(1) maintained that a CA specimen SFSU 2176 identified as Hydnellum conigenum is really H. aurantile (and note also the orthographic variant of the species epithet). RANGE Hydnellum auratile is found at least in WA and Europe according to Hall(3).

ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Hydnellum complectipes is a member of the H. aurantiacum complex. Features include 1) a large fruitbody with many fused caps forming a complicated mass, 2) caps referred to as red-orange to orange-brown in description but "yellowish brown" in the key, with orangish or yellowish or whitish margins, 3) flesh orange zoned with thin brown lines, 4) teeth light brown to grayish brown with paler tips, 5) a stem that is a single, fused, compact, complex mass and often not obviously duplex, and 6) farinaceous odor and taste. Hall also describes var. disjunctipes in which the stems of fused caps are separate, although they may be fused at their extreme bases, the stem is duplex, and young caps are scrobiculate and orange, becoming brown when old.^ Note that Harrison & Grund do not include Hydnellum complectipes in their 1987 key of Hydnellum species of North America known to them, (Harrison(4)): possibly they were unsure that it is distinct from Hydnellum aurantiacum.

ENGLISH NAME(S)  concrescent corky spine fungus, zonate tooth, zoned tooth
NOTES  Features include 1) a top-shaped to funnel-shaped, reddish brown to yellowish brown or wine-brown cap with a white growing margin, 2) tough flesh zoned reddish brown and darker in stem, 3) teeth that are pinkish brown or reddish brown or purplish brown, 4) variably shaped stem colored similarly to cap and blackening when bruised, 5) weak farinaceous odor and somewhat bitter taste, and 6) growth in forests with caps often joined together. Hydnellum scrobiculatum var. zonatum, also known as Hydnellum zonatum, is considered a synonym. Hydnellum concrescens is a member of the Hydnellum scrobiculatum group, in which we currently include Hydnellum concrescens, Hydnellum scrobiculatum, and Hydnellum subsuccosum.^ These three, along with 2 unnamed species are included in the Hydnellum concrescens complex of Baird(3) that reflects a clade in their DNA research in southeastern North America. The Baird(3) molecular study showed 5 branches, one considered to be H. concrescens and another Hydnellum subsuccosum. See the NOTES under Hydnellum scrobiculatum group for a discussion of whether one of those branches is H. scrobiculatum. RANGE There are collections at the University of British Columbia for BC and WA, collections at Pacific Forestry Center from BC (determined by K. Harrison as H. scrobiculatum var. zonatum), a collection from OR (as Hydnellum parvum) at Oregon State University, collections from WA and OR at University of Washington (some as H. zonatum). (Some of these collections in various herbaria might fall under Hydnellum subsuccosum described in 1964.) Hydnellum concrescens is quite common under hardwoods in eastern North America but also occurs on the west coast both in its normal form and a diminutive one whose cap is 4cm broad or less, (Arora). Hydnellum concrescens is widespread in the northern hemisphere, and found throughout Europe (including the United Kingdom and Switzerland), commonly in some areas, and is also present in North America and much of Asia, (Pegler(3)).

NAME ORIGIN  means 'becoming joined together'
SIMILAR  Hydnellum scrobiculatum is closely related, having fruitbodies of a similar form and color, but H. concrescens differs most notably in its more distinctly zoned and radially grooved cap, smaller spores, and the distinct dark green stain that exudes from the flesh in alkali solution, (Pegler(3), note however that Lincoff(1) says the flesh of Hydnellum scrobiculatum reacts violet then olive-green with KOH). H. scrobiculatum is much less distinctly zoned and more scaly, but Maas Geesteranus (1975) maintained there was no reliable macroscopic feature to separate the two species, (Breitenbach). H. scrobiculatum is quite distinct from H. concrescens in its typical form but they appear to intergrade, (Arora). Hydnellum subsuccosum, described by K.A. Harrison 1964, occurs according to him in WA and OR, and is synonymized with H. concrescens in the online Species Fungorum, accessed October 21, 2009, perhaps following Maas Geesteranus 1975 as cited by Baird(2). Baird(3) says that Baird(2) "supports the view based on morphological data that the two are the same", but the text in Baird(2) says "Maas Geesteranus (1975) listed this species as contaxic with Hydnellum concrescens. After studying the type material, I believe the two are distinct.". Baird(3) says "Molecular sequence ITS data supports that this species is distinct and had a 99% similarity to GenBank accession # AY569033.1." The latter sequence was generated for a thesis at University of Wisconsin-Lacrosse in 2003 by S. Westmoreland. (See also SIMILAR under H. subsuccosum).

NOTES  Features include small size, single or rosette form, funnel-shaped caps, thin bright orange brown flesh that is not zoned, and orange brown stem with a felty base.^ The description derived from Coker is for the type collection. Hall(3) does not mention this species for Washington but does include H. auratile which Harrison(4) does not include among North American Hydnellum species known to them: it is possible that the two names are referring to the same taxon in the Pacific Northwest. The two taxa are close enough that Franklin(1) reassigns a collection identified as H. conigenum from California to H. aurantile [sic] on the basis that the nearly 5cm preserved cap is too large for H. conigenum. According to Harrison(3), it is common in the Pacific Northwest. RANGE Hydnellum conigenum is found from NM to BC and the Great Lakes region, (McKnight). It is reported also from FL, (McKnight) and ID (Coker). Collections were seen from NM to BC, including the type locality ID, and there is a collection from MI, (Harrison(3)).

NAME ORIGIN  named after C.H. Peck who collected the type
SIMILAR  Hydnellum diabolus Banker (also known as H. diabolum Banker) is a similar species synonymized by Maas Geesteranus with Hydnellum peckii. Baird(2) disagrees, saying that the cap of H. diabolus is strigose hairy, and that of H. peckii bald (and may be highly colliculose or scrobiculate at the disc). Harrison(3) also disagrees, saying that H. diabolus has a strong pleasant odor of bee balm and the surface appears hirsute (unevenly strigose under the lens) and rarely matted. Hydnellum peckii on the other hand has a slightly disagreeable odor, and the surface is very uneven with numerous projections and a covering that is cottony fibrillose and mats down, taking on a very dark appearance, the differences in the surfaces being readily apparent in the herbarium. Harrison(4) gives H. peckii as having a white cap with red droplets when young, darkening and scrobiculate when old, dark matted cuticular mycelium 'apparent amyloid', whereas H. diabolus is "Not as above" and has velutinous [velvety] cap, with red droplets, cuticular hyphal mycelium not 'apparent amyloid'. According to Hall(3), the stem of H. diabolum is irregularly thickened, while that of H. peckii is regularly thickened by a definite spongy layer, and the cap of H. diabolum is tomentose, while that of H. peckii is bald when old. Franklin(1) says that some CA collections have a strigose surface that fits the H. diabolus concept. There are collections at the University of British Columbia from BC, WA, and OR labeled Hydnellum diabolus. Smith(15) reports it from OR but describes a "very strong somewhat pungent-farinaceous" odor, bitter-farinaceous taste that leaves a pronounced burning sensation in the throat, and a layer of tomentum that covers the rapidly growing parts. Hall(3) reports that when specimens were examined at the herbarium of the University of Michigan in 1965, it became apparent that the species in the Pacific Northwest is H. peckii. The existence of Hydnellum diabolus in the Pacific Northwest is open to further investigation. See also SIMILAR section of Hydnellum cumulatum and Hydnellum scrobiculatum.

LATIN NAME(S)  Hydnellum scrobiculatum  (Fr.) P. Karst. ^  Meddeland. Soc. Fauna Fl. Fenn. 5: 41. 1879  group
ENGLISH NAME(S)  rough Hydnellum, ridged tooth
NOTES  Hydnellum scrobiculatum is a member of the Hydnellum scrobiculatum group, but it is not clear that it occurs in the Pacific Northwest or even in North America. Features that have been ascribed to it include 1) a roughened often scrobiculate cap that is whitish becoming reddish brown or more yellowish brown or darker brown, 2) red droplets that may be present on the cap when young, 3) absence of conspicuous zones on cap, 4) dark bruising especially on cap margin, 5) duplex flesh that is zoned and often has white dots, 6) usually decurrent teeth that are whitish to dark brown, 7) a tough stem that is cinnamon brown or colored more or less like cap and often has a buried swollen base, the swelling due to an outer corky layer, 8) mild to farinaceous odor and taste, 9) growth scattered or in fused clusters, and 10) microscopic characters including tuberculate-echinulate spores.^ |The three members we are assigning to the Hydnellum scrobiculatum group currently are Hydnellum scrobiculatum, Hydnellum concrescens, and Hydnellum subsuccosum. These three, along with 2 unnamed species are included in the Hydnellum concrescens complex of Baird(3) that reflects a clade in their DNA research in southeastern North America. |Harrison(3) distinguishes var. zonatum (here synonymized with Hydnellum concrescens) by its being thinner, rarely as scrobiculate and typically more conspicuously zonate compared with the type variety. |Hall says that var. zonatum is "generally more delicate or with prominent excreted granules on the pileal surface and no ornamentation on the umbilicate disc". He found in WA two forms of var. zonatum. He says that forma zonatum of this variety has a deeply depressed or umbilicate cap, the cap surface has obvious color zonations but is never pitted or scrobiculate on the disc, and excreted granules are abundant and conspicuous in fresh and dried material. Forma parvum of var. zonatum on the other hand is smaller (to 4cm tall, to 3.5(5)cm wide) and more delicate than the other form, with a slender stem, the cap pitted on the disc or umbilicate, with faint color zones towards the cap margin. (Hall(3)). |Baird(3) discuss the difficulties in separating Hydnellum scrobiculatum and Hydnellum concrescens. They say that Maas Geesteranus reported in 1974 that the only way to distinguish the two species was by spore ornamentation: tuberculate-exsculpate for H. concrescens and tuberculate-echinulate for H. scrobiculatum - this was true for European collections but he also indicated that there was overlap of those characters for the two species from North America. [exsculptate appears to mean with a depression at the tip of the tubercle, as opposed to the tip being flat, rounded, or acute; echinulate would apply to acute tubercles or narrow rounded ones]. Various other morphological criteria have been used but are of uncertain value. Baird(3) say that their initial separation into two groups based on spore morphology did not correlate with the five species suggested by the molecular phylogenetic tree. While one of the branches of the tree consists of Hydnellum scrobiculatum, they say it is possible that H. scrobiculatum does not occur in North America and species being described in the study may be a taxon closer to H. concrescens. They also say "These results do not support the belief that H. scrobiculatum actually occurs in North America." (Baird(3) with Latin names italicized). |RANGE H. scrobiculatum is found in the Pacific Northwest and northern CA, (according to Arora(1)), and specifically in WA (Hall). There are collections from BC under this name deposited at Pacific Forestry Center (including both var. scrobiculatum and var. zonatum determined by K.A. Harrison). A collection from OR labeled Hydnellum scrobiculatum is deposited at Oregon State University. Collections were examined from NC and OH, (Coker). H. scrobiculatum has been widely reported in the eastern and central United States and Canada, and also in Europe. It is widely reported in North America from the Atlantic to the Pacific in forested areas and from Canada to Alabama. (Harrison(3)). It also occurs in Europe including Switzerland (Breitenbach).

ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Features include 1) flat to funnel-shaped caps that are "walnut-brown" flecked with yellowish crystals, and lighter over margin, 2) cap surface rough with radial ridges and tufts, 3) cap-colored, zoned flesh that has a pinkish juice that can be squeezed out, 4) fine, close spines that are cap-colored or slightly redder, 5) a rooting, dark vinaceous brown stem (leading to several caps) with a rough surface that has very little spongy tissue, 6) mild odor and taste, and 7) growth under conifers.^ Hydnellum subsuccosum is a member of the Hydnellum scrobiculatum group and some authors have synonymized it with Hydnellum concrescens, including Maas Geesteranus in 1975. We currently include Hydnellum concrescens, Hydnellum scrobiculatum, and Hydnellum subsuccosum in the Hydnellum scrobiculatum group. These three, along with 2 unnamed species are included in the Hydnellum concrescens complex of Baird(3) that reflects a clade in their DNA research in southeastern North America. Baird(3) say, "H. subsuccosum is within a clade containing the H. concrescens complex, but its position is not resolved" (Baird(3) with Latin names italicized). The other names in the complex are uncertain - see a fuller discussion of the group in the NOTES for H. concrescens and the Hydnellum scrobiculatum group. The description derived from Harrison(1) below should be used to understand his concept in describing it as a new species. The description derived from Hall(3) below might not be the same species, given the uncertainty of the species concepts within the Hydnellum concrescens group. RANGE Hydnellum subsuccosum is found in WA and OR (Harrison).

Harrison(8) says of this species in the original description, "It has a peculiar whitish hoary appearance as it grows. ... The pileus expands very close to the surface of the ground or duff and the stipe varies in length according to the depth of the duff." The description is derived from the original one in Harrison(8).

SIMILAR  Hydnum olympicum is also pale ("very pale ochraceous brown with more whitish areas intermixed") but spores are larger, averaging 8.6 x 7.3 microns (Niskanen(10)). Hydnum neorepandum is also pale ("cream-colored, sometimes with an orange tint") but the species is described as "(medium to) large" with a cap width of 4-11cm - more collections would be needed to see if this is consistent. The Niskanen(10) key separates them by a key lead with Q average 1.07-1.13 for species including pale H. melleopallidum and 1.15-1.20 for species including H. neorepandum, but the Q ranges overlap in the species descriptions. Hydnum albertense Niskanen & Liimat. Mycologia in press is closely related but separate genetically, with a holotype from Hinton, Alberta. It is similar in macromorphology and micromorphology but has a somewhat less colorful cap, described as "cream-colored to very pale ochraceous brown, paler towards the margin".

NOTES  Hydnum repandum itself has not been found in North America. The term Hydnum repandum group is an artificial group to describe what we have been calling Hydnum repandum in North America (excluding Hydnum umbilicatum). |Features of the Hydnum repandum group include a convex to depressed cap up to 17cm across or larger that is tan to pale orange or even reddish-tawny; white flesh; whitish to pale orange teeth; a relatively short stem that is cap-colored or paler; a bruising reaction to orange on cap, in cap flesh, and on the teeth and stem; white spore deposit; and microscopic characters.^ |Following the molecular work of Niskanen(10), Hydnum repandum is well documented only from Europe. The most closely related species in North America is Hydnum neorepandum - Niskanen(10) documented this new species from NL and from an ectomycorrhizal root tip in CA, but they also described several other new Hydnum species using Pacific Northwest collections. |Hall found what he called the type variety (described below) in WA as well as two other varieties (the first only tentative because it is basically an intermediate between H. repandum and H. umbilicatum): 1) Dentinum repandum var. macrosporum Hall & Stuntz nom. prov. (spores 9.0-9.8 x 7.6 microns) and cap "pinkish-buff" to "cinnamon-buff" (like var. repandum and unlike Hydnum umbilicatum, var. macrosporum has a large convex or slightly depressed cap), and 2) Dentinum repandum var. album (Quel.) K.A. Harrison = Hydnum repandum var. album (Quel.) Rea, with white cap and smaller spores 6.7-7.3 x 4.7-6.7 microns, (Hall). |Not all authors agree with the Hall(1) synonymy of Hydnum washingtonianum Ell. & Ev. which is mentioned by Castellano(2) with larger spores than H. umbilicatum and pink tones to the cap and also differentiated by Harrison(4) (see SIMILAR). |RANGE H. repandum group is widely distributed in United States and Canada, including FL, NC, NY, PA, and TN, and is common in Europe, (Coker). There are collections from WA, OR, and CA at Oregon State University, and collections from BC at Pacific Forestry Centre and University of British Columbia. The University of Washington also has collections from AK. It has been reported from ID by Andrew Parker, pers. comm.

NAME ORIGIN  from Latin, "bent backwards", (Lincoff(1)), from Latin "repandum" meaning "spreading", (Schalkwijk-Barendsen)
SIMILAR  Hydnum umbilicatum has a smaller cap, 2-6.5cm, commonly 4.5cm across, that is abruptly umbilicate, a long and slender stem 0.5-1(1.5)cm wide, and larger spores (9.0-10.0 x 7.0-8.6 microns), (Hall). H. umbilicatum is generally smaller, has a darker orangish, distinctly umbilicate cap, longer, more slender stem, and slightly larger spores (7.5-10 x 6.5-8.5 microns instead of 6.5-8.5 x 6-8.5 microns), (Trudell(4)). |Hydnum washingtonianum is differentiated in the key of Harrison(4) but not clearly, as can be seen by quoting the three key entries that lead up to it. The first key entry says "2. Pileus convex, color pinkish cinnamon to apricot-buff; spores 6-7 x 7-8.5 um......H. repandum" as opposed to "2. Pileus usually under 7cm; rusty orange......3" The next lead says :"3. Spores 6-7 x 7-8.5 um.....H. rufescens" as opposed to "3. Spores larger, pileus variably colored.......4" and the last lead says "4 Pileus tan to rusty-orange; umbilicate; spores 6-7.5 x 8-9.5 um......H. umbilicatum" as opposed to "4. Pileus color similar to H. repandum; spores 6-9.5 x 7-10(11) um......H. washingtonianum". [The Latin names are underlined and um rendered with the Greek letter mu plus 'm'.] Even when these key leads are written out in parallel fashion (not possible in this format), it is hard to imagine the fungus that would take the user of the key to H. washingtonianum.

LATIN NAME(S)  Hydnum 'umbilicatum'  Peck^  Bull. N.Y. State Mus. 54. 953. 1902;  Dentinum umbilicatum  (Peck) Pouzar
ENGLISH NAME(S)  navel tooth fungus, depressed hedgehog
NOTES  Features include 1) relatively small, slender fruitbodies 2) a pale orange ochraceous to ochraceous cap that often has a distinct depression in the center, 3) non-decurrent to somewhat decurrent, whitish teeth that become pale ochraceous brown, 4) a relatively long, slender stem that is whitish but bruises very pale brownish ochraceous, 5) fruiting on the ground under conifers, and 6) spores that average 8.7-8.1 microns (Niskanen(10) for Hydnum cf. umbilicatum). The term Hydnum umbilicatum group could be used to include small, slender Hydnum species with ochraceous to orange brown caps and predominantly nondecurrent gills - it would include Hydnum cf. 'umbilicatum, Hydnum oregonense, and Hydnum melitosarx, which are most reliable differentiated by spore size (in the absence of sequencing).^ Niskanen(10) describe a taxon as Hydnum cf. umbilicatum because the type of Hydnum umbilicatum was not sequenced. Potential candidates for H. umbilicatum Peck (described from NY) currently known from eastern North America are H. canadense, H. mulsicolor, H. submulsicolor, H. quebecense, and H. cf. umbilicatum. The only one of these to produce at least some spores over 8.3 microns wide (as observed in the holotype) was H. cf. umbilicatum. "We therefore conclude that among the currently known eastern North American species, the one presented here [H. cf. umbilicatum] best fits the type material of H. umbilicatum" (Niskanen(10) with Latin name italicized). In addition to the description derived from Niskanen(10) for Hydnum cf. umbilicatum, the Hall(1) and Castellano(2) descriptions for Hydnum umbilicatum are used for further detail even though their concepts would likely have included Hydnum oregonense as well (spore length given as 9.0-10 microns in both cases). RANGE The distribution of Hydnum cf. umbilicatum is circumboreal (Niskanen(10) who used specimens from BC, WA, NL, QC, TN, Germany, Finland, Slovenia, and China). Hydnum 'umbilicatum' is found in WA, OR, CA, (Castellano), BC (collections at Pacific Forestry Centre and University of British Columbia), eastern North America and the Great Lakes area, (Phillips), NC (Coker), and NY (Peck's holotype).

NOTES  Also listed in Clubs category. Fruitbodies are single or densely grouped soft wax-like white hanging spines up to 0.6cm long, growing on conifer wood or old polypores.^ Corner(3) considered Mucronella alba Lloyd a synonym of Mucronella bresadolae, but note the difference in spore size from the European description of Breitenbach(2). The online Species Fungorum, accessed February 17, 2012, listed Mucronella alba Lloyd as a synonym of Mucronella pendula, as does Petersen(28). Mucronella alba could be regarded as an ambiguous name, but Siegel(2) use this name Mucronella alba for what has been called Mucronella bresadolae in the Pacific Northwest. RANGE Mucronella 'bresadolae' is found at least in BC, Austria, France, and Morocco, (Corner(3)), and Switzerland (Breitenbach). Corner's listing for BC appears to refer to R. Bandoni 116 (1958) at the University of British Columbia where it is still labeled Mucronella alba, but there are two other later UBC collections from BC labeled M. bresadolae, one of them by R. Bandoni 12743A (2000). Desjardin(6) illustrates it for CA.

ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Also listed in Clubs category. Fruitbodies are pear-shaped to conic, white, and watery, with a distinct ochraceous to yellowish stem, hanging down in groups from conifer wood.^ Petersen emphasizes the watery character: "Because the watery texture of the fruitbodies seems so consistent over a very wide geographical range, and because this character is apparently incongruous in Mucronella..." [genus name italicized]. The description is derived from Petersen(28). RANGE Collections were examined from BC, WA, CA, and Australia, (Petersen(28)).

SIMILAR  Mucronella alba Lloyd is described by Lloyd as follows "MUCRONELLA ALBA, FROM J.M. GRANT, WASHINGTON (Fig. 1509) Plants white, about 5 mm. long, caespitose, growing in clusters on bark, subiculum none. Basidia clavate, persisting on dried specimen. Spores sub-globose 6 X 8. This little species is exactly the same as Mucronella aggregata; figured on page 531, excepting it is about six times as large. Our enlargement sixfold (Fig. 725) could be taken for this species natural size." [The illustration of Mucronella alba is not helpful, and the illustration of M. aggregata is not clear enough to show stipes.]. Petersen(28) regards Mucronella alba as a synonym of Mucronella pendula based on examination of the scanty material in which he says he found material that he interpreted as stipes. Mucronella alba is best regarded as an ambiguous name.

NOTES  Features of this commonly reported fungus include a brown cap with a depressed center and with large, coarse, truncate, darker scales, brown teeth that are not decurrent, a white to brown stem that is longer than the cap width and widens at the base, a somewhat disagreeable, sour odor, a mild to bitter taste, growth under conifers especially spruce, and microscopic characters including clamp connections.^ |Johannesson(1) separated the variant under pine (as opposed to spruce) by molecular and macroscopic (but not microscopic characters) as Sarcodon squamosus (Schaeff.) Quel. Johannesson(1) states, "The pine form has a yellow brown to vinaceous brown pileus with blackish brown scales, the margin of the pileus remains for a long time incurved, and the centre is not or only slightly depressed. When old or dried the pileus of the pine form is distinctly darker than the pileus of the spruce form. The scales are usually smaller than in the spruce form, especially near the margin of the pileus. The broad scales in the centre are not or only slightly pointed upwards. The spines are slightly decurrent, rather short and crowded, greyish and when fresh often with a tint of greyish blue. The stipe is short, usually of about the same length as the diameter of the pileus or shorter, attenuated at the base, and normally distinctly paler at the apex. The context is whitish but sometimes blackish brown in the stipe base. The smell is aromatic, spicy."..."The spruce form has a brown pileus with brown scales, the margin of the pileus does not remain incurved for a long time, and the centre is always depressed, often even infundibuliform or hollow. The pileus of the spruce form is distinctly paler and the broad scales in the centre are usually pointed almost straight upwards. The spines are not decurrent, quite long and brown. The stipe is long, normally longer than the diameter of the pileus, cylindrical or often slightly bulbous at the base, and not paler at the apex. The context is dirty whitish-brownish, not darker in the base of the stipe. The smell is somewhat disagreeable, sour".

SIMILAR  Sarcodon squamosus 1) has a vinaceous to brown cap, often dark vinaceous brown to purplish black, 2) has slightly smaller scales, 3) is less likely to be deeply sunken at the disk, 4) favors pine habitat, and 5) dyes wool bluish green as opposed to grayish beige for S. imbricatus, (Siegel(2)). Sarcodon leucopus is similar in size, color, and spore size and ornamentation, but the scales on the cap never become reflexed at the tips and a deep depression does not develop on the cap over the stem as is typical in Sarcodon imbricatus, (Franklin). S. leucopus has a smooth convex cap without free scales (may be minutely areolate [cracked like dried mud] or with small flat scales), spines are more delicate and crowded and somewhat paler, and the stem is not enlarged at the base, (Coker discussing Sarcodon laevigatus). Sarcodon scabrosus 1) has a finely scaly or cracked, pinkish brown cap when young, becoming scalier and brown when old, 2) has a bluish stem base, 3) has a strongly bitter taste, and 4) favors pine habitat, (Siegel(2)).

NAME ORIGIN  
SIMILAR  Sarcodon underwoodii has a light brown (yellowish brown) cap, spines up to 0.35cm long, and taste immediately bitter, whereas Sarcodon scabrosus has vinaceous brown cap, spines up to 0.5cm long, and taste slowly bitter, (Baird(1)). S. underwoodii has a light brown cap, fine close spines, extremely bitter taste, and habitat in deciduous woods, whereas S. scabrosus has brown cap sometimes with vinaceous shades, spines coarser, taste bitter, and habitat in coniferous woods, (Harrison(4)). Sarcodon imbricatus has larger scales and lacks the olive-black stem base (Arora). S. imbricatus has only slightly bitter taste and lacks the blackish base of the stem, (Harrison(8)). S. imbricatus also has clamp connections (Harrison(4)). Sarcodon fennicus may occur in the Pacific Northwest, but there are problems with different ways that it is described. CAP 5-10cm broad, reddish brown to brown, smooth becoming more or less scaly, russet brown with darker scales. TEETH 0.3-0.5cm long, pale buff with darker brown tips. STEM rather long and tapering. ODOR pleasant. TASTE described as intensely bitter (Arora(1)), or peppery and unpleasant (Phillips(1)). Phillips (1) says it is found in eastern North America, has a dark blue-green to blackish olive stem base, and the KOH does not give a green reaction. Smith(4) say it is widely distributed, the stem base is blackish olive to bluish green, and it does not have the S. scabrosus KOH reaction where the subcutis and context become blue-green. Arora (1) says it has a blackish stem base and does not stain blue-green in KOH. McKnight (1) says it is a European species that turns black not blue green in KOH . Harrison(8) mentions only that the flesh does not turn blue-green or black in KOH. However, Harrison (4) say it is found in western North America, the base of the stem is not olive-black, and in KOH the surface of the cap is blue-green. The 1888 Latin description in Saccardo's Syll. fung. VI: 433; IX: 208; XII: 964; XIX: 895. says "basi albo-tomentello, extus intusque subcaerulente-atrato", meaning "the base white-tomentose, exterior and interior somewhat blue-black". The presence of S. fennicus in the Pacific Northwest would have to be confirmed together with which of the senses is being used. See also SIMILAR section of Sarcodon rimosus.

ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Features include 1) a vinaceous to brown cap that is often dark vinaceous brown to purplish black, 2) a dry, scaly cap surface that often become slightly depressed, 3) spines that are beige to grayish, becoming grayish brown with paler tips, and finally all brown, 4) a beige to pale dingy brown stem that stains brown when handled (base is often dark brown but not bluish, even inside), and 5) growth under conifers, particularly pine.^ Sarcodon squamosus used to be considered a variant of Sarcodon imbricatus (see SIMILAR here and NOTES under Sarcodon imbricatus for further information). Sarcodon squamosus dyes wool bluish green (Siegel(2)). Sarcodon imbricatus only gives wool a grayish beige color, (Siegel(2)). RANGE Sarcodon squamosus occurs in BC (Ian Gibson, pers. comm.) and herbarium collections are likely deposited as Sarcodon imbricatus, of which S. squamosus was considered a synonym. It also occurs in CA (Siegel(2)), and probably in Washington and Oregon.
CHEMICAL REACTIONS  KOH no reaction

SPORE DEPOSIT  brown
MICROSCOPIC  spores 7-8 x 5-6.5 microns, nearly round or elliptic "with blunt, irregular projections"^
NAME ORIGIN  means 'with scales'
SIMILAR  Sarcodon imbricatus "often has a paler-colored cap with slightly larger scales", "tends to be sunken or depressed at the disc", "dyes wool wood a grayish beige color" (bluish green for S. squamosus), and in California prefers and is possibly restricted to Sitka spruce forest, (Siegel(2)). Sarcodon scabrosus occurs under shore pine and may grow alongside S. squamosus - it has "a finely scaly or cracked, pinkish brown cap when young, becoming scalier and brown" when old, a bluish stem base, and a strongly bitter taste, (Siegel(2)). Sarcodon rimosus has 1) "a smooth purplish gray blushed cap when young, which becomes brown and scaly in age", 2) short, whitish to lilac-gray spines that become grayish brown, 3) a strong farinaceous odor, 4) a slightly bitter, farinaceous taste, and 5) an olive-black KOH reaction on the cap, (Siegel(2)).

ENGLISH NAME(S)  confluent Sistotrema, aromatic earthfan
NOTES  Sistotrema confluens forms small white fan-shaped or part-funnel-shaped caps with thin, lobed margins, that often grow together so that a cap has several stems. The color may turn yellowish, orange, or brownish when the fruitbodies are old or bruised. The underside forms spines of various shapes and lengths (often flattened) and also ridges, sometimes even appearing poroid or gill-like. The cap surface is smooth to wrinkled: under a hand lens the surface is tomentose. The lateral stem tapers to a black base. There is a vanilla to disagreeable odor and mild taste. It fruits on needles, leaves, and other litter in the summer and fall. Microscopic characters include narrowly elliptic spores, 6-8-spored basidia, and a monomitic hyphal system.^ RANGE The accompanying photograph is from a WA collection. S. confluens is reported from AB, NS, QC, AZ, MI, MT, NC, NH, NY, VT, WI, (Ginns(5)), examined from ON, MI, NC, NH, TN, VA, and reported from AL, (Coker(1)), and found in the British Isles (Buczacki) and Finland and Sweden (Eriksson(7)).
