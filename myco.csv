"233","NOTES","  Calvatia cyathiformis is distinguished from other large puffballs by the spore mass that becomes purple and by the distinct, typically well-developed sterile base. However, if Calvatia fragilis is considered a synonym of Calvatia cyathiformis (see more details below on that question), the Calvatia fragilis description should be consulted as well since it represents the more common variation and the sterile base is inconspicuous. Other features of Calvatia cyathiformis include 1) a spherical to top-shaped or pear-shaped fruitbody, 2) a thin exoperidium (outer layer) that is white to pale brown and smooth or floccose, slightly scaly, often cracking into broad patches in its upper part, 3) an endoperidium (inner layer) that is thin and purplish, both layers flaking off, 4) a spore mass that becomes deep purplish brown, and 5) spiny spores.^ |Jarvis(1) wrote in 2014, 'Calvatia cyathiformis and Calvatia fragilis are two very closely related species, possibly even the same species. Bates (2004) showed in phylogenetic analysis that they form a well-supported monophyletic sister group. They have similar morphological features, except for three main differences: 1) overall size; 2) subgleba size and shape; and 3) subgleba cellular density. Calvatia cyathiformis has a very large and broadly bulbous to clavate-shaped subgleba that is arguably a true pseudostipe, whereas C. fragilis has a narrow reduced subgleba that is more tapered at the end, rooting it into the ground, and not acting as a true pseudostipe. The former will grow up to 80-130 mm tall x 70-130 mm broad, while C. fragilis is almost half the size, 35-60 mm tall x 40-70 broad. Calvatia fragilis has subgleba tissue with smaller chambers and a more compact appearance than Calvatia cyathiformis. Historically Calvatia cyathiformis and Calvatia fragilis have been listed as a forma and as a variety of Calvatia cyathiformis; Calvatia cyathiformis forma/var. cyathiformis and as Calvatia cyathiformis forma/var. fragilis. DNA sequence analysis confirms that they are sister to each other, but with careful examination, the morphology shows that they can be recognized as distinct species (Kreisel 1992, Bates 2004). One specimen in the UC Berkeley herbarium (UCB506673, RP Brandt 1913) was labeled as <U+0093>Fungi of California,<U+0094> without any location or habitat data. This specimen is clearly of C. cyathiformis, with a robust pseudostipe up to three inches long. Therefore it could be possible that C. cyathiformis has been collected in California, but very rarely.' |She also wrote, ""The two species Calvatia fragilis and Calvatia cyathiformis have been treated as different species in previous works (Kreisel 1992, Bates 2004). The evidence from multiple collections from California reveals that Calvatia fragilis is distinctly different than Calvatia cyathiformis. In addition, the molecular data shows that these two are different."" (Jarvis(1), with Latin names italicized). |Zeller was inclined to recognize Clavaria fragilis as a species (Zeller(3)), note in Zeller(13), but in finishing her work on Calvatia after her death A.H. Sm. reduced C. fragilis to C. cyathiformis forma fragilis (Vitt.) A.H. Sm. (Zeller(13)). Not all authors agree that they are separate species, and both Cyathus fragilis (Quel.) Morgan and Lycoperdon fragile (Vitt.) were considered synonyms of Calvatia cyathiformis (Bosc.) Morgan in the online Species Fungorum, accessed April 1, 2018.

The two species must be differentiated microscopically.^ ""Early gleba development in young basidiocarps of S. stellatus is marked by the formation of globular knots of binucleate hyphae. These later become centers around which new basidia are formed, eventually producing four (occasionally eight) basidiospores per basidium. The basidia entirely break down and disappear as soon as the spores are mature, making room for the enlargement and maturation of other basidia. In S. iowensis, the development of young basidia is followed by the formation of characteristic cavities or chambers in which the spores are produced (Walker, 1927). In addition, the glebal covering (peridium) consists of a three-layered endoperidium and three-layered exoperidium in S. stellatus, whereas in S. iowensis a gelatinous layer in the outer peridium is absent (Walker, 1927).""

"1468","NOTES","  Also listed in Bird's Nests category. Sphaerobolus stellatus produces small, white to dull orange spheres growing gregariously on wood, plant debris, or manure, which split into star-like rays exposing the chestnut brown to olive-black egg which is shot out, leaving the translucent whitish receptacle turned inside out. The spore distribution mechanism is remarkable in that the fungus can project its peridioles up to 6 meters, normally toward the brightest light in its environment, hence acquiring the common names ""artillery fungus"" and ""cannonball fungus"". In recent years this fungus has attracted attentions because the peridioles are difficult to remove from house siding, windows, and cars.^ Basidiospores are stimulated to germinate in the digestive system of mammals that have ingested them with plant material. If they are not ingested, the asexual spores can germinate directly on wood or plant debris. (Geml(2)). The flight of the ""egg"" has been measured at 14 feet high and 17 feet long, and light is apparently needed for the trigger mechanism as the flight does not happen in the dark, (Arora). Turning on a light in a dark room may trigger the release of the sphere, (Lincoff(2)). Lincoff(1) notes after describing Sphaerobolus stellatus, ""On the basis of size and habitat various similar species have been described which may be considered as varieties of S. stellatus: S. giganteus, reaching 4 mm in diameter; S. solen, with cylindrical carpophores; S. stercorarius, globose, completely buried in droppings of herbivores; S. muscosus, covered with an abundant mycelium; S. brasiliensis, like the above with larger spores, 10-12 x 6-7 microns."" In 2005 it was discovered that Sphaerobolus iowensis was as common as or more common than S. stellatus (see NOTES under S. iowensis). S. stellatus is traditionally considered with bird's nests but in Dictionary of the Fungi, 10th Edition, it is assigned to the Geastraceae. RANGE Sphaerobolus stellatus has been reported from BC (P. Kroeger, pers. comm.), WA (D. Oliver, pers. comm.), OR (Zeller(2)), ID (Trueblood(1)), and CA (MykoWeb). It is said to be widely distributed in eastern North America west to MI and TX, (Phillips), and throughout eastern United States, west to MI, OH, IA, LA, (Lincoff(2)). It is said to occur in Europe and North Africa, (Courtecuisse), including the United Kingdom (Palmer(1)); however, some of these records may be Sphaerobolus iowensis. The attached photos could also be S. iowensis. Geml(1) confirmed by molecular means a distribution for Sphaerobolus stellatus including at least AK, MA, MD, MN, PA, and the Netherlands, and a map in Geml(2) shows additional data points in OR, CO, MO, and NC.",82,10

The University of Michigan has several collections submitted by Ellen Trueblood and by Nancy Smith Weber from ID, some determined in 1994 by D. Prusso and some by J. Wright (as T. subfuscum). The last is curious, because J. Wright in 1992 was co-author of Moreno(2) which proposed that this taxon be renamed as a variety of T. pulchellum.",114,4

Vascellum lloydianum is close to Vascellum pratense and has been regarded as a synonym, so that Pacific Northwest records of Vascellum pratense may be the same species as Vascellum lloydianum even if the two are different species. The close but not identical relationship is supported in the molecular study of Jarvis(1). Both species (or the one species if they are the same) may be better placed in Lycoperdon. The current name of Vascellum pratense in the online Species Fungorum, accessed March 31, 2018 was Lycoperdon pratense but MycoBank, accessed the same day, gave the current name as Vascellum pratense. The master<U+0092>s thesis of Jarvis(1) combines Vascellum lloydianum provisionally as Lycoperdon lloydianum. By whatever name Vascellum lloydianum is fairly common in the Pacific Northwest. RANGE The holotype of Vascellum lloydianum is from WA. It has been known by several other names: Lycoperdon depressum Bonorden, Vascellum depressum (Bon.) F. Smarda, Calvatia depressa (Bon.) Zeller & Smith, (Zeller(13) who examined a collection from OR and said it was common in the Pacific Coast states), and Vascellum pratense (Pers.: Pers.) Kreisel, with which some authors synonymize the four other names, or the last three of the four. A.H. Smith differentiates Vascellum lloydianum A.H. Sm. from V. pratense (see SIMILAR), using collections from WA and giving range as ""grassy areas west of the Great Plains, especially in the Pacific Northwest"", while giving the range of Vascellum pratense (Pers.) Kreisel as ""Asia, Europe, possibly rarely in eastern North America"". The same taxon (or one very close) is recorded from CA (Arora(1)). Vascellum lloydianum has been collected in AZ (Bates).

"2165","SIMILAR","  Vascellum pratense (Pers.) Kreisel (Lycoperdon pratense Pers. according to the online Species Fungorum, accessed January 24, 2015) is similar. 1) It has the lower part of the endoperidium with rare hyphae with thick colored walls (V. lloydianum having the lower portion of endoperidium with numerous hyphae with thick, colored walls, some of which extend into the spore mass as eucapillitial threads). 2) V. pratense also has a well developed diaphragm between spore mass and sterile base (poorly developed to absent in V. lloydianum). 3) spores are ""punctate to minutely warty"" (in V. lloydianum ""subsmooth"" or ""smooth in optical section but surface minutely verruculose under oil""). (Smith(39)). Ramsey reports a collection from the University of Washington campus that fits at least the macroscopic description of V. pratense better than that of V. lloydianum, (Ramsey(1)). L. pratense and L. lloydianum ""are very similar in outward appearance, which can cause confusion and misidentification among them. Lycoperdon pratense has non-poroid eucapillitium that is scarce to absent, and can be found only along the endoperidium wall in mature gasterocarps, as long as gleba tissue is still present. As well, Lycoperdon pratense has a wide and very well developed diaphragm that can be seen earlier in development than that in Lycoperdon lloydianum (Ponce de Leon 1970, Bates 2004). Both of these grassland species have been collected together in the same habitat. Close examination of the diaphragm and growth of the eucapillitium is necessary for proper treatment of these species."" (Jarvis(1) with Latin names italicized). Lycoperdon species do not have the thin papery membrane that separates the sterile base from the spore mass in Vascellum species, (Trudell).",121,5
